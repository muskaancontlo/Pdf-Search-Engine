Introduction 

1 

This insurance policy is a legal contract between the policy-owner 
(you) and the company (we or us). It insures you and your auto for 
the period shown on the Coverage Selections Page. 

As long as you pay your premium, we agree to provide you or others 
the benefits to which you or they are entitled. The exact terms and 
conditions are explained in the following pages. 

There are two basic categories of insurance described in this policy, 
Compulsory Insurance and Optional Insurance. 

Compulsory There are four Parts to Compulsory Insurance. They are all re-
Insurance quired by law. Every auto registered in Massachusetts must have 
them. 

Optional 
There are eight Parts to Optional Insurance. Some of them extend 

Insurance 
the coverage or the amounts of protection provided by Compulsory 
Insurance. Some of them provide protection not found in Compulsory 
Insurance. You do not have to buy any of these eight Parts if you do 
not want to. 

Auto insurance claims arise in hundreds of different ways. Autos are 
sometimes stolen or damaged. Accidents may injure people in your 
auto, people in other autos or pedestrians. You may be responsible 
for an accident or someone else may be. An accident may happen in 
Massachusetts or out of state. Different situations require different 
kinds of insurance. 

Please read the whole policy to see what kinds of insurance are 
available to cover these different situations. At the same time, you 
should check the Coverage Selections Page to make sure it correctly 
indicates the coverages you purchased. Each coverage you 
purchased will show a premium charge next to it. If no premium 
charge is shown, you do not have that coverage. 

Sometimes you and we will agree to change this policy. The only way 
that can be done is by an Endorsement added to the basic policy 
form. All endorsements must be in writing. They then become part of 
this policy. 

We are pleased to have you as a customer and hope you have a safe 
and accident-free year. But if you need us, we are here to help you. If 
you have an accident or loss, or if someone sues you, contact your 
agent or us. 

Do the same if you have any questions or complaints. If you think we 
have treated you unfairly at any time, you may contact the Division of 
Insurance, (617) 521-7777.

Our Agreement 

This policy is a legal contract under Massachusetts law. Because 
this is an auto policy, it only covers accidents and losses which 
result from the ownership, maintenance or use of autos. The exact 
protection is determined by the coverages you purchased. 

We agree to provide the insurance protection you purchased for 
accidents which happen while this policy is in force. 

You agree to pay premiums when due and to cooperate with us in 
case of accidents or claims. 

Our contract consists of this policy, the Coverage Selections Page, 
any endorsements agreed upon, and your application for insurance. 
Oral promises or statements made by you or our agent are not part 
of this policy. 

There are many laws of Massachusetts relating to automobile 
insurance. We and you must and do agree that, when those laws 
apply, they are part of this policy.

Compulsory 
Insurance 

There are four Parts to Compulsory Insurance. They are called 
Compulsory Insurance because Massachusetts law requires you to 
buy all of them before you can register your auto. No law requires 
you to buy more than this Compulsory Insurance. However, if you 
have financed your auto, the bank or finance company may legally 
insist that you have some Optional Insurance as a condition of your 
loan. 

The amount of your coverage and the cost of each Part is shown on 
the Coverage Selections Page. 

Your Compulsory Insurance does not pay for any damage to your 
auto no matter what happens to it. 

Part 1. 
Under this Part, we will pay damages to people injured or killed by 

Bodily Injury 
your auto in Massachusetts accidents. The damages we will pay 

To Others 
are the amounts the injured person is entitled to collect for bodily 
injury through a court judgment or settlement. We will pay only if you 
or someone else using your auto with your consent is legally 
responsible for the accident. The most we will pay for injuries to one 
or more persons as a result of bodily injury to any one person in any 
one accident is $20,000. Subject to this $20,000 limit, the most we 
will pay for injuries to two or more people as the result of bodily injury 
to two or more people in any one accident is $40,000. This is the 
most we will pay as the result of a single accident no matter how many 
autos or premiums are shown on the Coverage Selections Page. 

We will not pay: 

1. For injuries to guest occupants of your auto. 
2. For accidents outside of Massachusetts or in places in Massa-
chusetts where the public has no right of access. 
3. For injuries to any employees of the legally responsible person if 
they are entitled to Massachusetts workers compensation benefits. 
The law provides a special protection for anyone entitled to damages 
under this Part. We must pay their claims even if false statements 
were made when applying for this policy or your auto registration. We 
must also pay even if you or the legally responsible person fails to 
cooperate with us after the accident. We will, however, be entitled to 
reimbursement from the person who did not cooperate or who made 
any false statements. 

If a claim is covered by us and also by another company authorized to 
sell auto insurance in Massachusetts, we will pay only our 
proportionate share. If someone covered under this Part is using an 
auto he or she does not own at the time of the accident, the owners 


 Compulsory 
Insurance 
(Continued) 

5 

auto insurance must pay its limits before we pay. Then, we will pay, up 
to the limits shown on your Coverage Selections Page, for any damages 
not covered by that insurance. 

Part 2. The benefits under this Part are commonly known as PIP or No- 
Personal Injury Fault benefits. It makes no difference who is legally responsible for 
Protection the accident. 

We will pay the benefits described below to you and other people injured 
or killed in auto accidents. For any one accident, we will pay as many 
people as are injured, but the most we will pay for injuries to any one 
person is $8,000. This is the most we will pay no matter how many 
autos or premiums are shown on the Coverage Selections Page. 

We will pay three kinds of benefits: 

A. Medical Expenses 
We will pay all reasonable expenses incurred as a result of the accident 
for necessary medical, surgical, X-ray and dental services. This includes 
prosthetic devices. It also includes ambulance, hospital, professional 
nursing and funeral services. 

B. Lost Wages 
If an injured person is out of work because of the accident, we will pay 
lost wages up to 75% of his or her average weekly gross wage or 
equivalent for the year ending on the day immediately before the 
accident. We will not pay for the loss of any other type of income. If the 
injured person was unemployed at the time of the accident, we will pay 
up to 75% of the amount he or she actually lost in earning power as a 
result of the accident. 

C. Replacement Services 
We will reimburse the injured person for reasonable payments made to 
anyone outside his or her household for necessary services that he or 
she would have performed without pay for the benefit of the household, 
had he or she not been injured. 

We will pay PIP benefits to or for: 

1. You, or any other person, if injured while occupying your auto with 
your consent. 
2. You, or anyone living in your household, if injured while occupying 
an auto which does not have Massachusetts Compulsory Insurance or if 
struck by an auto which does not have Massachusetts Compulsory 
Insurance 
3. Any pedestrian, including you, if struck by your auto in 

6 
6 
Compulsory 
Insurance 
(Continued) 

Massachusetts or any Massachusetts resident who, while a 
pedestrian, is struck by your auto outside of Massachusetts. 

Benefits are paid only for expenses or losses actually incurred within 
two years after the accident. 

If the accident is in Massachusetts, or if it is outside Massachusetts 
and the injured person does not sue for damages, we will pay benefits 
within a reasonable time  usually thirty days. If the accident is 
outside Massachusetts and the injured person does sue, then we can 
wait for a settlement or judgment before paying benefits. 

Some people have a wage continuation program at work. If so, we 
will pay them only the difference between the total we would ordinarily 
pay under this Part and the amount of the program payments. 
We will, however, reimburse the program if it allows benefits to be 
converted into cash or additional retirement credit. Sometimes 
program benefits are reduced or used up because of payments to the 
person injured in an accident. In that case, we will pay for lost wages 
resulting from any other illness or injury that person has within one 
year of our last payment. The exact amount of our payments under 
this paragraph will be determined by Massachusetts law. 

Some people have a policy of health, sickness, or disability insur- 
ance or a contract or agreement with a group, organization part- 
nership or corporation to provide, pay for, or reimburse the cost of 
medical expenses (health plan). If so, we will pay up to $2,000 of 
medical expenses for any injured person. We will also pay medical 
expenses in excess of $2,000 for such injured person which will not be 
paid by a health plan. Medical expenses must be submitted to the 
health plan to determine what the health plan will pay before we pay 
benefits in excess of $2,000 under this Part. We will not pay for 
medical expenses in excess of $2,000 that the health plan would have 
paid had the injured person sought treatment in accordance with the 
requirements of the health plan. In any case, our total payment for 
medical expenses, lost wages and replacement services will not 
exceed $8,000. 

Within two years after an accident, we may, at our option, pay the cost 
of renewing or continuing in force a policy of health, sickness or 
disability insurance for anyone covered under this Part who is 
unwilling or unable to pay such cost. Our payment will not exceed the 
cost of renewing or continuing such policy for a period of two years 
after the accident. Also, our payment will not operate to reduce the 
benefits otherwise payable under this Part.

We will not pay PIP benefits to or for: 

1. Anyone who, at the time of the accident, was operating or 
occupying a motorcycle, any motor vehicle not subject to motor 
vehicle registration, or a motorized bicycle, including a moped. 
2. Anyone who contributed to his or her injury by operating an auto 
(a) while under the influence of alcohol, marijuana, or a narcotic drug, 
(b) while committing a felony or seeking to avoid arrest by a police 
officer, or (c) with the specific intent of causing injury to himself, 
herself or others. 
3. Anyone who is entitled to benefits under any workers 
compensation law for the same injury. 
When you purchased this Part you were given the choice of either 
excluding yourself, or yourself and household members, from some 
or all of the PIP coverage. The portion of each claim you may have 
agreed not to be covered for is called a deductible. You paid a 
smaller premium if you chose a deductible. In that case, we will only 
pay up to the difference between $8,000 and the amount of your 
deductible. The deductible is shown on the Coverage Selections 
Page. 

If anyone is entitled to PIP benefits and also to benefits under another 
Part of this policy, we will pay from this Part first. 

We will not pay PIP benefits to or for an injured person, to the 
extent those benefits would duplicate expenses or losses recovered 
by that person in a court judgment or settlement. 

If anyone covered under this policy is also entitled to PIP benefits from 
any other auto policy, the total benefits payable will not be more than 
the highest amount payable under whichever one of the policies would 
have paid the most. In that case, each insurer will pay only its 
proportionate share. We will not pay benefits under this Part which 
duplicate payments made under the No-Fault coverage of any other 
auto policy. 

Part 3. Sometimes an owner or operator of an auto legally responsible 
Bodily Injury for an accident is uninsured. Some accidents involve unidentified 
Caused By An hit-and-run autos. Under this Part, we will pay damages for bodily 
Uninsured Auto injury to people injured or killed in certain accidents caused by 

uninsured or hit-and-run autos. We will pay only if the injured person 
is legally entitled to recover from the owner or operator of the 
uninsured or hit-and-run auto. We will pay for hit-and-run accidents 
only if the owner or operator causing the accident cannot be identified.

Compulsory 
Insurance 
(Continued) 

Sometimes the company insuring the auto responsible 
for an accident will deny coverage or become insolvent. We consider 
such an auto to be uninsured for purposes of this Part. However, we do 
not consider an auto owned by a governmental unit or someone who is 
legally self-insured to be an uninsured auto. 

This Part is Compulsory. You must have limits of $20,000 per person 
and $40,000 per accident. However, you may want to buy more 
protection. If so, we must sell you limits up to $35,000 per person and 
$80,000 per accident, provided you have purchased at least these limits 
for Part 5. Higher limits may be purchased if agreed upon by you and 
by us. 

We will pay damages to or for: 

1. You, while occupying your auto, while occupying an auto you do 
not own, or if injured as a pedestrian. 
2. Any household member, while occupying your auto, while 
occupying an auto not owned by you or if injured as a pedestrian. If 
there are two or more policies which provide coverage at the 
same limits, we will only pay our proportionate share. We will not pay 
damages to or for any household member who has a Massachusetts 
auto policy of his or her own or who is covered by any Massachusetts 
auto policy of another household member providing uninsured auto 
insurance with higher limits. 
3. Anyone else while occupying your auto. We will not pay damages 
to or for anyone else who has a Massachusetts auto 
policy of his or her own, or who is covered by any Massachusetts auto 
policy of another household member providing uninsured 
auto insurance. 
4. Anyone else for damages he or she is entitled to recover because of 
injury to a person covered under this Part. 
If you are injured while occupying your auto and you have two or 
more autos insured with us with different limits, we will only pay up to 
the limits shown on your Coverage Selections Page for the auto you are 
occupying when injured. 

If you are injured as a pedestrian or while occupying an auto you do 
not own and you have two or more Massachusetts auto policies which 
provide coverage at different limits, the policy with the higher limits will 
pay. If there are two or more policies which provide coverage at the 
same limits, we will only pay our proportionate share. 

We will not pay damages to or for you, if struck by, or while occupying 


 Compulsory 
Insurance 
(Continued) 

9 

an auto you own and which does not have Massachusetts compulsory 
auto insurance. 

Likewise, we will not pay damages to or for any household member if 
struck by, or while occupying an auto owned by that household 
member which does not have Massachusetts compulsory auto 
insurance. 

The most we will pay for damages to or for anyone injured in the 
following situations is $35,000 per person and $80,000 per accident or 
the limits you purchased, whichever is less: 

1. Anyone injured while occupying your auto while it is being used 
as a public or livery conveyance. This does not apply to the use of 
your auto in a share-the-expense car pool arrangement or in an 
expense reimbursement program either as a volunteer or at work. 
2. Anyone injured while using an auto without the consent of the 
owner. 
3. Anyone injured while an auto is being operated in any 
prearranged or organized racing, speed, stunting or demolition contest 
or activity or in practice or preparation for any such contest or activity. 
We will reduce the damages an injured person is entitled to recover 
by: 

1. The amount recovered from any legally responsible person 
provided the injured person is fully compensated for his or her 
damages for bodily injury. 
2. The amount paid under a workers compensation law or similar 
law. 
3. Any expenses that are payable or would have been payable, 
except for a deductible, under the PIP coverage of this policy or any 
other Massachusetts auto policy. 
We will pay the balance of the damages up to the limits shown for this 
Part on your Coverage Selections Page. 

The determination as to whether an injured person is legally entitled to 
recover damages from the legally responsible owner or operator will 
be by agreement between us and the injured person. The amount of 
the damages, if any, will be determined in the same way. Arbitration 
will be used if no agreement can be reached. However, in no event 
may a demand for arbitration constitute first notice of claim. We must 
be given sufficient notice of claim to conduct a reasonable 
investigation and attempt settlement before arbitration can be filed.

Compulsory 
Insurance 
(Continued) 

If an injured person settles a claim as a result of an accident covered under this 
Part, we will pay that person only if the claim was settled with our consent. We 
will not be bound under this Part by any judgment resulting from a lawsuit 
brought without our written consent. We will not, however, unreasonably 
withhold our consent. 

The most we will pay for injuries to one or more persons as a result of bodily 
injury to any one person in any one accident is shown on the Coverage 
Selections Page as the per person limit. Subject to this limit, the most we will 
pay for injuries to two or more people as the result of bodily injury to two or more 
people in any one accident is shown on the Coverage Selections Page as the 
per accident limit. This is the most we will pay as the result of a single accident. 

The limits of two or more autos or policies shall not be added to- gether, 
combined, or stacked, to determine the limits of coverage available to anyone 
covered under this Part, regardless of the number of autos involved, persons 
covered, claims made, or premiums shown on the Coverage Selections Page. 

We will not make payments under this Part which duplicate payments under the 
uninsured auto insurance of any other auto policy. 

The Part will not benefit any insurer or self-insurer under a workers 
compensation law or any similar law. 

Part 4. 
Under this Part, we will pay damages to someone else whose auto 

Damage to 
or other property is damaged in an accident. The damages we will 

Someone Elses 
pay are the amounts that person is legally entitled to collect for 

Property 
property damage through a court judgment or settlement. We will pay only if you, 
or a household member, is legally responsible for the accident. We will also pay 
if someone else using your auto with your consent is legally responsible for the 
accident. Damages include any applicable sales tax and the costs resulting from 
the loss of use of the damaged property. 

We will not pay for property damage which occurs: 

1. While your auto is being used as a public or livery conveyance. This does 
not apply to the use of your auto in a share-the-expense car pool arrangement 
or in an expense reimbursement program either as a volunteer or at work. 
2. While any auto is being used by anyone in the course of his or her 
employment in the business of selling, servicing, repairing or parking autos. This 
exclusion does not apply to the ownership, maintenance or use of your auto by 
you or a household member. 
3. While anyone is using a vehicle in the course of any business other than the 
business of selling, servicing, repairing or parking autos. This exclusion does not 
apply to private passenger autos, or to pick-up 

 Compulsory 
Insurance 
(Continued) 

11 

trucks, vans, or similar vehicles having a gross vehicle weight of less than 
10,000 pounds and not used for the delivery or transportation of goods or 
materials unless such use is incidental to your business of installing, 
maintaining, or repairing furnishings or equipment. 

4. While a household member, other than your spouse, is using an auto 
which you or any household member owns or uses regularly unless a 
premium for this Part is shown for that auto on the Coverage Selections Page. 
5. While you or your spouse, if a household member, are using an auto 
which you or your spouse, if a household member, own or use regularly 
unless a premium for this Part is shown for that auto on the Coverage 
Selections Page. 
6. To an auto or other property owned by you or the legally responsible 
person. Similarly, we will not pay for damage to an auto or other property, 
except for a private residence or garage, which you or the legally responsible 
person rents or has in his or her care. 
7. When the property damage is caused by anyone using an auto without the 
consent of the owner. 
The most we will pay for damage resulting from any one accident is shown on 
the Coverage Selections Page. This is the most we will pay as the result of a 
single accident no matter how many autos or premiums are shown on the 
Coverage Selections Page. 

If someone covered under this Part is using an auto he or she does not own at 
the time of the accident, the owners auto insurance must pay its limit before 
we pay. Then, we will pay for any damages not paid by that insurance, up to 
the policy limit shown on the Coverage Selections Page. However, if the claim 
is covered by us and another auto policy, we will pay only our proportionate 
share of those damages not paid by the owners auto insurance. 

Under this Part, we may have to pay for property damage even if you or the 
legally responsible person fails to give us prompt notice of the accident. In 
that case we may be entitled to reimbursement from that person. 

This Part is Compulsory. You must have limits of at least $5,000. However, 
you may want to buy more protection. Higher limits may be purchased if 
agreed upon by you and by us. However, $5,000 is the most we will pay for 
property damage caused by an auto covered under this Part which is being 
operated in any prearranged or organized racing, speed, stunting or demolition 
contest or activity or in practice or preparation for any such contest or activity.

Optional 

Insurance 

There are eight separate Parts to Optional Insurance. They are called 
Optional Insurance because they are not required by law. The 
amount of insurance and cost of any of these Parts you purchased is 
shown on the Coverage Selections Page. 

With the exception of Towing and Labor (Part 11), we must sell you 
any or all of the Optional coverages you wish, subject to certain 
deductibles and limits specified in Massachusetts law. However, 
Massachusetts law provides that we may refuse to sell Collision (Part 
7) and Comprehensive (Part 9), or both, in certain specified instances. 

Because two of the Optional coverages  Collision (Part 7) and 
Limited Collision (Part 8)  duplicate each other in many ways, you 
may buy one of them but not both. If you do not buy either one, you 
still have the right to sue people who damage your auto but we will 
not provide any assistance to you under this policy. 

We will not pay under any of the Optional coverages: 

1. If the accident happens while your auto is being used as a public 
or livery conveyance. This does not apply to the use of your auto in a 
share-the-expense car pool arrangement or in an expense 
reimbursement program either as a volunteer or at work. 
2. For loss of any items used in the reproduction of sound, unless 
they have been permanently installed in the auto. However, we will 
pay for the loss of any such item if it operates in the auto exclusively 
and only when used in combination with the components permanently 
installed in the auto. Tapes, discs, and records are not covered. 
3. For loss of or damage to a citizens band radio, two-way mobile 
radio, telephone or scanning monitor receiver, including their related 
equipment. We will pay, however, for such loss or damage if this 
equipment is permanently installed in the opening of the dash or 
console normally used by the auto manufacturer for the installation of 
a radio or a telephone. 
4. For loss of or damage to any custom furnishings or custom 
equipment in or upon any pick-up truck, van or similar vehicle. 
Custom furnishings or custom equipment include but are not limited to 
the following items: special carpeting and insulation, furniture, bars, 
television receivers, facilities for cooking and sleeping, height-
extending roofs, custom murals, paintings or other decals or graphics. 
5. For loss or damage to equipment designed for the detection or 
avoidance of any law enforcement speed measuring device. This 
does not apply to electronic equipment designed solely for safety 
warning systems. 

 Optional 
Insurance 
(Continued) 

13 

6. For injury or damage that is intentionally caused by you, a 
household member or anyone else using your auto with your 
consent. 
Part 5. 
Under this Part, we will pay damages to people injured or killed in 

Optional Bodily 
accidents if you or a household member is legally responsible for 

Injury to Others 
the accident. We will also pay damages if someone else using your 
auto with your consent is legally responsible for the accident. The 
damages we will pay are the amounts the injured person is entitled to 
collect for bodily injury through a court judgment or settlement. 

This Part is similar to Compulsory Bodily Injury To Others (Part 1). 
Like the Compulsory Part, this Part pays for accidents involving your 
auto in Massachusetts. Also like the Compulsory Part, this Part does 
not pay for the benefit of anyone using an auto without the consent of 
the owner. 

Unlike the Compulsory Part, this Part does provide coverage for 
injuries to guest occupants and for accidents occurring outside 
Massachusetts. 

In addition, we will not pay: 

1. For injuries to employees of the person using the auto who are 
injured in the course of employment. 
2. For injuries resulting from an accident while a household 
member, other than your spouse, is using an auto which you or any 
household member owns or uses regularly, unless a premium for 
this Part is shown for that auto on the Coverage Selections Page. 
3. For injuries resulting from an accident while you or your spouse, if 
a household member, are using an auto which you or your spouse, if 
a household member, own or use regularly unless a premium for this 
Part is shown for that auto on the Coverage Selections Page. 
4. While any auto is being used by anyone in the course of his or her 
employment in the business of selling, servicing, repairing, or parking 
autos. This exclusion does not apply to the ownership, maintenance 
or use of your auto by you or a household member. 
5. While anyone is using a vehicle in the course of any business 
other than the business of selling, servicing, repairing or parking 
autos. This exclusion does not apply to private passenger autos, or to 
pick-up trucks, vans, or similar vehicles having a gross vehicle weight 
of less than 10,000 pounds and not used for the delivery or 
transportation of goods or materials unless such use is incidental to 
your business of installing, maintaining, or repairing furnishings or 
equipment.

If the accident occurs in any other state or in a Canadian province and 
you have purchased any coverage at all under this Part, your policy 
will automatically apply to that accident as follows: 

If the state or province has: 

1. A financial responsibility law or similar law specifying limits of 
liability for bodily injury or property damage higher than the limits you 
have purchased, your policy will provide the higher specified limits. 
2. A compulsory insurance or similar law requiring your auto to have 
insurance whenever it is used in the state or province, your policy will 
provide at least the required minimum amounts and types of 
coverage. 
The limits shown for this Part on the Coverage Selections Page are 
the total limits you have under Compulsory Bodily Injury to Others 
(Part 1) and this Part. This means that the Compulsory limits are 
included within the limits shown on the Coverage Selections Page for 
this Part and are not in addition to them. 

The most we will pay for injuries to one or more persons as a result of 
bodily injury to any one person in any one accident is shown on the 
Coverage Selections Page as the per person limit for the auto 
involved in that accident. Subject to this limit, the most we will pay for 
injuries to two or more people as the result of bodily injury to two or 
more people in any one accident is shown on the Coverage Selections 
Page as the per accident limit for the auto involved in that accident. 
This is the most we will pay as the result of a single accident no matter 
how many autos or premiums are shown on the Coverage Selections 
Page. 

If someone covered under this Part is using an auto he or she does 
not own at the time of the accident, the owners auto insurance must 
pay its limits before we pay. Then, we will pay for any damages not 
paid by that insurance, up to the policy limits shown on your Coverage 
Selections Page. However, if the claim is covered by us and another 
auto policy, we will pay only our proportionate share of those damages 
not paid by the owners auto insurance. 

Any payments we make to anyone or for anyone under Bodily Injury 
Caused By An Uninsured Auto (Part 3) will reduce the amount of 
damages that person is entitled to recover from anyone covered under 
this Part. 

We will also pay up to $250 for the cost of bail bonds required as a 
result of an accident covered under this Part including bail bonds for 
traffic law violations related to the accident.

We must sell you limits up to $35,000 per person and $80,000 per 
accident if you want to buy them. Higher limits may be purchased if 
agreed upon by you and by us. However, while an auto covered under 
this Part is being operated in any prearranged or organized racing, 
speed, stunting or demolition contest or activity or in practice or 
preparation for any such contest or activity, the most we will pay is the 
required minimum limits. 

Part 6. Under this Part, we will pay reasonable expenses for necessary 
Medical Payments medical and funeral services incurred as a result of an accident. 

We will pay for expenses resulting from bodily injuries to anyone 
occupying your auto at the time of the accident. We will also pay for 
expenses resulting from bodily injuries to you or any household 
member if struck by an auto or if occupying someone elses auto at 
the time of the accident. 

We will not pay for expenses resulting from injuries to: 

1. Anyone injured while in a vehicle which had been placed off the 
public roads for use as a residence. 
2. Anyone injured in the course of employment in selling, servicing, 
repairing or parking autos if that person is entitled to workers 
compensation benefits. 
3. Anyone employed by you or your spouse who is injured in the 
course of employment. This exception does not apply to any do- 
mestic employee who is not entitled to any workers compensation 
benefits. 
4. Anyone injured while occupying an auto without a reasonable 
belief that he or she had the consent of the owner to do so. 
5. A household member, other than your spouse, while occupying 
or struck by an auto owned or regularly used by you or any 
household member unless a premium for this Part is shown for that 
auto on the Coverage Selections Page. 
6. You or your spouse, if a household member, while occupying or 
struck by an auto owned or regularly used by you or your spouse 
unless a premium for this Part is shown for that auto on the Coverage 
Selections Page. 
We will not pay for expenses incurred more than two years after the 
date of the accident. We will not pay under this Part for any ex- 
penses that are payable, or would have been payable except for a 
deductible, under the PIP coverage of this policy or any other Mas-
sachusetts auto policy.

The most we will pay for any one person as a result of any one 
accident is shown on the Coverage Selections Page. This is the most 
we will pay as the result of a single accident no matter how many 
autos or premiums are shown on the Coverage Selections Page. 

If someone covered under this Part is also entitled to Medical 
Payments coverage under another auto policy issued to you or any 
household member, we will pay only our proportionate share. If 
someone covered under this Part is using an auto he or she does not 
own at the time of the accident, the owners automobile Medical 
Payments insurance must pay its limit before we pay. Then, we will 
pay up to the limit shown on your Coverage Selections Page for any 
expenses not covered by that insurance. 

We will not pay benefits under this Part which duplicate payments 
made under the Medical Payments coverage of any other auto policy. 

We must sell you limits of $5,000 per person if you want to buy them. 
Higher limits may be purchased if agreed upon by you and us. 
However, while an auto covered under this Part is being operated in a 
prearranged or organized racing, speed, stunting or demolition contest 
or activity or in practice or preparation for any such contest or activity, 
the most we will pay is the required minimum limits. 

Part 7. 
Under this Part, we will pay for any direct and accidental damage to 

Collision 
your auto caused by a collision. It does not matter who is at fault. 
We will also pay for collision damage to other private passenger 
autos while being used by you or a household member with the 
consent of the owner. However, we will not pay for damage to any 
auto which is owned or regularly used by you or a household 
member unless a premium for this Part is shown for that auto on the 
Coverage Selections Page. We will not pay if an accident occurs 
while an auto covered under this Part is being operated in any 
prearranged or organized racing, speed, stunting or demolition contest 
or activity or in practice or preparation for any such contest or activity. 

We will pay for each loss up to the actual cash value of the auto 
or any of its parts at the time of the collision. If the repair of a 
damaged part will impair the operational safety of the auto we will 
replace the part. In all cases we will subtract the deductible amount 
you selected. Unless you selected a different amount, the law sets 
your deductible at $500. Your deductible is shown on the Coverage 
Selections Page. 

We will not pay for a collision loss for an accident which occurs while 
your auto is being operated by a household member who is not 
listed as an operator on this policy. Payment is withheld when the 


 Optional 
Insurance 
(Continued) 

17 

household member, if listed, would require the payment of additional 
premium on this policy because: 

1. the household member would be classified as an inexperienced 
operator, or 
2. a higher rating step would be assigned under the Safe Driver 
Insurance Plan. 
You must notify us within 60 days after a person who will operate your 
auto becomes a household member, if that person was not a 
household member on the effective date of your policy. In the same 
manner, you must notify us if a household member, who will operate 
your auto, becomes a licensed operator. 

If we pay for the total loss of your auto, we will suspend the Collision 
Coverage for that auto until it passes a Motor Vehicle Inspection Test. 

Camper bodies are not covered under this Part unless specifically 
shown on the Coverage Selections Page or by endorsement. An 
additional premium will be charged for insuring a camper body. 

If an auto covered under this Part is not owned by you at the time of 
the accident, the owners auto insurance must pay its limit before we 
pay. Then, we will pay, up to the limit shown on your Coverage 
Selections Page, for any damage not covered by that insurance less 
the deductible amount you selected. 

Part 8. 
Under this Part, we will pay in some situations for direct and acci- 

Limited Collision 
dental damage to your auto caused by a collision. We will also pay 
in these situations for damage to other private passenger autos while 
being used by you or a household member with the consent of the 
owner. However, we will not pay for damage to any auto which is 
owned or regularly used by you or a household member unless a 
premium for this Part is shown for that auto on the Coverage 
Selections Page. We will not pay if an accident occurs while an auto 
covered under this Part is being operated in any prearranged or 
organized racing, speed, stunting or demolition contest or activity or in 
practice or preparation for any such contest or activity. 

We will not pay for a loss for an accident which occurs while your 
auto is being operated by a household member who is not listed as 
an operator of this policy. Payment is withheld when the household 
member, if listed, would require the payment of additional premium on 
this policy because: 

1. the household member would be classified as an inexperienced 
operator, or 

18

(Continued) 

2. a higher rating step would be assigned under the Safe Driver 
Insurance Plan. 
You must notify us within 60 days after a person who will operate your 
auto becomes a household member if that person was not a 
household member on the effective date of your policy. In the 

same manner, you must notify us if a household member, who will 
operate your auto, becomes a licensed operator. 

The protection under this Part is not as broad as under Collision 
coverage but the premium is considerably less. 

We only pay under this Part for multiple car accidents in which the 
driver of the auto we are covering was no more than 50% at fault. We 
will not pay if the owner of the other auto cannot be identified. After a 
claim under this Part we are required to determine whether the driver 
of the auto we are covering was more than 50% at fault. We will notify 
you of our determination. 

As long as the driver of the auto covered under this Part was not more 
than 50% at fault, his or her percentage of fault will not affect the 
amount of our payment. 

We will pay for each loss up to the actual cash value of the auto 
or any of its parts at the time of the collision. If the repair of a 
damaged part will impair the operational safety of the auto we will 
replace the part. In all cases we will subtract the deductible amount 
you selected. Unless you selected a different amount, the law sets 
your deductible at $500. Your deductible is shown on the Coverage 
Selections Page. 

We will consider the driver of the auto covered under this Part to be no 
more than 50% at fault if: 

1. That auto was legally parked when struck by another auto. 
2. That auto was struck in the rear by another auto moving in the 
same direction. 
3. The operator of the other auto was convicted of certain violations 
listed in Massachusetts law or any similar law of another state in 
which the accident occurs. However, we will not pay if the operator of 
the auto covered under this Part was also convicted of one of the 
same violations. 
4. That driver is entitled to recover in court against an identified 
person for some reason other than those listed above.

If we pay for the total loss of your auto, we will suspend the Limited 
Collision Coverage for that auto until it passes a Motor Vehicle 
Inspection Test. 

Camper bodies are not covered under this Part unless specifically 
shown on the Coverage Selections Page or by endorsement. An 
additional premium will be charged for insuring a camper body. 

If an auto covered under this Part is not owned by you at the time of 
the accident, the owners auto insurance must pay its limit before we 
pay. Then, we will pay, up to the limit shown on your Coverage 
Selections Page, for any damage not covered by that insurance less 
the deductible amount you selected. 

Part 9. Under this Part, we will pay for direct and accidental damage to or 

Comprehensive loss of your auto other than damage caused by collision. We will 
also pay for such damage or loss to other private passenger autos 
while being used by you or a household member with the consent of 
the owner. However, we will not pay for such damage or loss to any 
auto which is owned or regularly used by you or a household 
member unless a premium for this Part is shown for that auto on the 
Coverage Selections Page. We will reimburse you for substitute 
transportation expenses if your auto is stolen. 
This Part is not a substitute for Collision (Part 7) or Limited Collision 
(Part 8). 

We consider glass breakage when not involving other collision loss, 
and the following types of losses to be Comprehensive and not 
Collision losses: losses caused by vandalism, fire and theft, mis- 
siles, falling objects, larceny, explosion, earthquake, windstorm, hail, 
water, flood, malicious mischief, riot or contact with a bird or animal. 

However, we will not pay if an accident occurs while an auto covered 
under this Part is being operated in any prearranged or organized 
racing, speed, stunting or demolition contest or activity or in practice 
or preparation for any such contest or activity. 

We will pay for each loss up to the actual cash value of the auto or 
any of its parts at the time of loss. If the repair of a damaged part will 
impair the operational safety of the auto we will replace the part. In all 
cases we will subtract the deductible amount you selected. Unless 
you selected a different amount, the law sets your deductible at $500. 
Your deductible does not apply to glass breakage or substitute 
transportation expenses following a theft. 

If your auto is stolen, you must report the theft to us and the police. 
We will reimburse you only for transportation expenses incurred after 


20 
20 
Optional 
Insurance 
(Continued) 

the first 48 hours following those reports. We will not pay for 
transportation expenses incurred prior to that time. After that, we 
will reimburse you up to $15 a day to a maximum of $450. 

Your right to reimbursement stops on the day your auto is located 
or before that time if we pay you for the theft loss. 

If you choose not to rent an auto, we will reimburse you up to the 
same amount for taxicab fares, bus fares and other transportation 
expenses. If your auto is found, we will pay the cost of transporting 
it to your last address shown on the Coverage Selections Page. 
However, our total payment for transporting the auto and for repairs 
will not be more than the actual cash value of the auto. 

If your auto is damaged by fire, you must report the loss to us and 
the fire department. 

Massachusetts law requires that if we pay for the total loss of your 
auto as a result of a fire or theft, we may suspend coverage for a 
fire or theft loss under this Part for any replacement auto unless it is 
made reasonably available for our inspection within two Registry of 
Motor Vehicles business days following the day you acquired it. We 
may also raise your deductible unless you install an approved anti-
theft device in the replacement auto. 

Camper bodies are not covered under this Part unless specifically 
shown on the Coverage Selections Page or by endorsement. An 
additional premium will be charged for insuring a camper body. 

If an auto covered under this Part is not owned by you at the time 
of the accident, the owners auto insurance must pay its limit before 
we pay. Then, we will pay, up to the limit shown on your Coverage 
Selections Page, for any damage or loss not covered by that insur- 
ance less the deductible amount you selected. 

Part 10. Under this Part, we will reimburse you in certain situations up to 
Substitute the limits shown on your Coverage Selections Page. We will reim-
Transportation burse you if your auto was in a collision and is being repaired or 

replaced. We will also reimburse you if your auto cannot be used 
because of the kind of damage or loss, including theft, that is covered 
under Comprehensive (Part 9). 

We will not make any payments unless you lose the use of your 
auto for at least 24 hours. 

We will pay only for a period of time which is reasonable for having 
your auto repaired or replaced. 


 Optional 
Insurance 
(Continued) 

21 

If your auto is stolen, you must report the theft to us and the police. We 
will reimburse you only for transportation expenses incurred after the first 
48 hours following those reports. We will not pay for transportation 
expenses incurred prior to that time. 

Under Comprehensive (Part 9) there is also substitute transportation 
coverage when your auto is stolen. If you purchase both Comprehensive 
and $15/$450 limits under this Part, Comprehensive will pay first until its 
coverage is no longer available. Then this Part will pay. If you purchase 
$30/$900 limits under this Part, the most we will pay under Comprehensive 
(Part 9) and this Part is up to $30 a day to a maximum of $900. 

If you purchase $100/$3,000 limits under this Part, the most we will pay 
under Comprehensive (Part 9) and this Part is up to $100 a day to a 
maximum of $3,000. 

The Coverage here will not duplicate any Comprehensive payments. 

If you choose not to rent an auto, we will reimburse you up to the same 
amounts for taxicab fares, bus fares and other transportation expenses. 

Part 11. Under this Part, we will pay up to the limit shown on your Coverage 

Towing and Labor Selections Page for towing and labor costs incurred each time your 
auto is disabled. We will pay only for labor done at the scene to the 
extent that the labor was needed to get your auto going. We will 
not pay for the cost of repair parts. 

Part 12. Sometimes an owner or operator of an auto legally responsible for 
Bodily Injury an accident is underinsured. Under this Part, we will pay damages 
Caused By An for bodily injury to people injured or killed as a result of certain 
Underinsured Auto accidents caused by someone who does not have enough insurance. 

We will only pay if the injured person is legally entitled to recover from the 
owners or the operators of all underinsured autos. Such injured person has 
a claim under this Part when the limits for automobile bodily injury liability 
insurance covering the owners and operators of the legally responsible 
autos are: 

1. Less than the limits shown for this Part on your Coverage Selections 
Page; and 
2. Not sufficient to pay for the damages sustained by the injured person. 
We will pay damages to or for: 

1. You, while occupying your auto, while occupying an auto you do not 
own, or if injured as a pedestrian. 
2. Any household member, while occupying your auto, while 

22 
22 
Optional 
Insurance 
(Continued) 

occupying an auto not owned by you, or if injured as a pedestrian. If 
there are two or more policies which provide coverage at the same limits, 
we will only pay our proportionate share. We will not pay damages to or for 
any household member who has a Massachusetts auto policy of his or her 
own or who is covered by a Massachusetts auto policy of another 
household member providing underinsured auto insurance with higher 
limits. 

3. Anyone else while occupying your auto. We will not pay damages to 
or for anyone else who has a Massachusetts auto policy of his or her own 
or who is covered by a Massachusetts auto policy of another household 
member providing underinsured auto coverage. 
4. Anyone else for damages he or she is entitled to recover because of 
injury to a person covered under this Part. 
If you are injured while occupying your auto and you have two or more 
autos insured with us with different limits, we will only pay up to the limits 
shown on your Coverage Selections Page for the auto you are occupying 
when injured. 

If you are injured as a pedestrian or while occupying an auto you do not 
own and have two or more Massachusetts auto policies which provide 
coverage at different limits, the policy with the higher limits will pay. If there 
are two or more policies which provide coverage at the same limits, we will 
only pay our proportionate share. 

We will not pay to or for: 

1. You, while occupying an auto you own unless a premium charge is 
shown for that auto on your Coverage Selections Page. 
2. Anyone injured while occupying your auto while it is being used as a 
public or livery conveyance. This does not apply to the use of your auto in 
a share-the-expense car pool arrangement or in an expense reimbursement 
program either as a volunteer or at work 
3. Anyone injured while using an auto without the consent of the owner. 
4. Anyone injured while an auto is being operated in any prearranged or 
organized racing, speed, stunting or demolition contest or activity or in 
practice or preparation for any such contest or activity. 
5. Any household member if struck by, or while occupying an auto 
owned by that household member which does not have Massachusetts 
compulsory auto insurance. 
We will reduce the damages an injured person is entitled to recover by: 

1. The total amount collected from the automobile bodily injury liability 
insurance covering the legally responsible owners and operators of all 
insured autos. 

 Optional 
Insurance 
(Continued) 

23 

2. The amount recovered from any legally responsible person provided the 
injured person is fully compensated for his or her damages for bodily injury. 
3. The amount paid under a workers compensation law or similar law. 
4. Any expenses that are payable or would have been payable, except for a 
deductible, under the PIP coverage of this policy or any other Massachusetts 
auto policy. 
If only one person sustains bodily injury, we will pay any unpaid damages up to 
the difference between the total amount collected from the automobile bodily 
injury liability insurance covering the legally responsible owners and operators of 
all insured autos and the per person limit shown for this Part on your Coverage 
Selections Page. This is the most we will pay for injuries to one or more persons 
as the result of bodily injury to any one person in any one accident. 

Subject to the per person limit, if two or more people sustain bodily injury and 
are entitled to coverage under this Part, we will pay any unpaid damages up to 
the difference between the automobile bodily injury liability insurance per 
accident limit covering the legally responsible owners and operators and the per 
accident limit shown for this Part on your Coverage Selections Page. This is the 
most we will pay for injuries to two or more people as the result of bodily injury to 
two or more people in any one accident. 

The determination as to whether an injured person is legally entitled to recover 
damages from the legally responsible owner or operator will be by agreement 
between us and the injured person. The amount of damages, if any, will be 
determined in the same way. Arbitration will be used if no agreement can be 
reached. However, in no event may a demand for arbitration constitute first 
notice of claim. We must be given sufficient notice of claim to conduct a 
reasonable investigation and attempt settlement before arbitration can be filed. 

If an injured person settles a claim as a result of an accident covered under this 
Part, we will pay that person only if the claim was settled with our consent. We 
will not be bound under this Part by any judgment resulting from a lawsuit 
brought without our written consent. We will not, however, unreasonably withhold 
our consent. 

The limits of two or more autos or policies shall not be added together, combined 
or stacked, to determine the limits of coverage available to anyone covered 
under this Part, regardless of the number of autos involved, persons covered, 
claims made, or premiums shown on the Coverage Selections Page. 

We will not make payments under this Part which duplicate payments under the 
underinsured auto insurance of any other auto policy. 

This Part will not benefit any insurer or self-insurer under a workers 
compensation law or any similar law.

General Provisions 
and Exclusions 

This section of the policy contains general provisions which, unless 
otherwise noted, apply to all your coverages. It also describes 
some situations in which policy benefits will not be paid. 

1. Where You 
Compulsory Bodily Injury To Others (Part 1) only covers accidents 
Are Covered 
in Massachusetts. All the other Parts provide coverage for acci-
dents and losses which happen in the United States or Canada. We 
consider United States territories and possessions and Puerto Rico 
to be part of the United States. We will pay for accidents and losses 
which happen while your auto is being transported between ports 
of the United States and Canada. Your auto is not covered in any 
other country. 

2. Our Duty To We have the right to defend any lawsuit brought against 
Defend You And anyone covered under this policy for damages which might be 
Our Right To Settle payable under this policy. We also have a duty to defend any such 
lawsuit, even if it is without merit, but our duty to defend ends when 
we tender, or pay to any claimant or to a court of competent 
jurisdiction, with the courts permission, the maximum limits of 
coverage under this policy. We may end our duty to defend at any 
time during the course of the lawsuit, by tendering, or paying the 
maximum limits of coverage under the policy, without the need for a 
judgment or settlement of the lawsuit or a release by the claimant. 

We have the right to settle any claim or lawsuit as we see fit. If any 
person covered under this policy settles a claim without our con- 
sent, we will not be bound by that settlement. 

3. Additional Costs 
We will pay, in addition to the limits shown for Compulsory and 
We Will Pay 
Optional Bodily Injury To Others (Parts 1 and 5) and Damage to 
Someone Elses Property (Part 4): 

A. Premiums on appeal bonds and premiums on bonds to release 
attachments for an amount up to the applicable limits you selected 
in any suit we defend. 
B. Interest that accrues after judgment is entered in any suit we 
defend. We will not pay interest that accrues after we have offered 
to pay up to the limits you selected. 
C. Up to $40 a day for loss of earnings, but not for loss of other 
income, to any person covered under this policy who attends hear-
ings or trials at our request. 
D. Other reasonable expenses incurred at our request. 

 General Provisions 
And Exclusions 
(Continued) 

25 

4. What Happens If you die, we will continue coverage for the period of this policy for: 
If You Die 
A. Your spouse, if a resident of your household at your death. 
B. Any legal representative to the extent he or she is responsible 
for maintenance or use of your auto. 
C. Any person having proper temporary custody of your auto. 
5. Our Right 
Sometimes we may make a payment under this policy to you or to 
To Be Repaid 
someone else who has a separate legal right to recover damages 
from others. In that case, those legal rights may be exercised by us. 
Anyone receiving payment under those circumstances must do 
nothing to interfere with those rights. He or she must also do what-
ever is necessary to help us recover for ourselves up to the amount 
we have paid. If we then recover more than we paid, we will pay 
that person the excess, less his or her proportionate share of the 
costs of recovery, including reasonable attorneys fees. Any amount 
recovered, because of a payment we make under Part 3 or Part 12 
of this policy, shall first be applied to any unpaid damages due that 
person. Such unpaid damages must be a part of a claim settled 
with our consent or a part of a judgment resulting from a lawsuit 
brought with our written consent. Any balance then remaining shall 
be applied to the amounts we have paid under Part 3 or Part 12. 
We will reduce the amount we will pay that person by his or her 
proportionate share of the costs of recovery including reasonable 
attorneys fees. 

Sometimes you or someone else may recover money from the 
person legally responsible for an accident and also receive money 
from us for the same accident. If so, the amount we paid must be 
repaid to us to the extent that you or someone else recovers. If you 
or someone else recover money from the person legally respon- 
sible for the accident and also receive money from us for the same 
accident as a payment under Part 3 or Part 12 of this policy, we 
must be repaid for any amounts so paid but only to the extent that 
such recovery exceeds any unpaid damages due that person under 
a claim settled with our consent or judgment resulting from a law- 
suit brought with our written consent. 

Whenever we are entitled to repayment from anyone, the amount 
owed us can be reduced by our proportionate share of the costs of 
recovering the money, including reasonable attorneys fees. 

In either case we do not have to be repaid for any money we have 
paid under Medical Payments (Part 6).

General Provisions 
And Exclusions 
(Continued) 

6. When You Have You may have more than one policy with us covering the same 
More Than One Auto accident. In that case, the most we will pay is the highest amount 
Policy With Us payable under the applicable coverage in any one of those policies. 
However, claims made under Bodily Injury Caused By An Uninsured Auto 
(Part 3) and Bodily Injury Caused By An Underinsured Auto (Part 12) are 
treated differently. The difference is explained in the description of the 
coverage for that Part. 

7. If You Go Bankruptcy or insolvency of any person covered under this policy 
Bankrupt does not relieve us of any of our obligations under this policy. 
8. We Do Not Pay We will not pay under Damage To Someone Elses Property (Part 
For Nuclear Losses 4) and Optional Bodily Injury To Others (Part 5) for any person who 
Or War Losses is an insured under a nuclear energy liability policy. The same is true for a 
person who would be an insured under such a policy had it not already 
exhausted its limits. 

We will not pay under Medical Payments (Part 6), Collision, Limited 
Collision or Comprehensive (Parts 7, 8 and 9) for losses or damage 
caused by radioactive contamination or by acts of war, insurrection, 
rebellion or revolution or any act incident to any of these. 

9. We Do Not Pay We will not pay for damage to your auto which is due solely to 
For Ordinary ordinary wear and tear, freezing, mechanical or electrical failure, or 
Wear Or Tear for ordinary road damage to tires. We will, however, pay for this damage if 
it is the result of some other loss which is covered by this policy. 

10. If We Pay 
If we pay for the total loss of your auto, we have the right, if we so 
For A Total Loss 
choose, to take title to that auto. We also have the right, if we so choose, 
to take any damaged part for which we pay. 

11. Repair And Under Collision, Limited Collision and Comprehensive (Parts 7, 8 
Payment After A and 9), you must allow us to have the auto appraised after a colli- 
Collision or Loss; sion or loss. If we have a direct payment plan approved by the 
If We Disagree Commissioner of Insurance, we will pay you in accordance with the 
On The Amount appraisal and allow you to select a repair shop of your choice. If 
of Damage you choose not to have your auto repaired, or if we do not receive 
(Parts 7, 8 and 9) your Repair Certification Form, or, when requested, you do not make your 
auto available for reinspection within a reasonable period of time following 
repair, our payments automatically reduce the actual cash value of your 
auto if you have further claims. If you later give us proof of proper repair, 
the actual cash value will be increased. 

If you choose not to accept payment under our direct payment plan or we 
do not have such a plan, and you have your auto repaired in accordance 
with the appraisal, you must send us a Completed Work Claim Form. We 
must pay you within 7 days after receiving the form. 


 General Provisions 
And Exclusions 
(Continued) 

27 

If we fail to pay you within 7 days after receipt of the Completed Work 
Claim Form, you have the right to sue us. If a court decides that we were 
unreasonable in refusing to pay you on time, you are entitled to double the 
amount of damage plus costs and reasonable attorneys fees. If you 
request us to, we will pay the repair shop directly, however, the repair shop 
must certify that it meets certain requirements. If you choose not to have 
your auto repaired, or if we do not receive your Completed Work Claim 
Form, we will determine the amount of decrease in the actual cash value of 
your auto and pay you that amount less your deductible. Our payment 
automatically reduces the actual cash value of your auto if you have 
further claims. If you later give us proof of proper repair, the actual cash 
value will be increased. We have a right to inspect all repairs. 

In any event, we will never pay more than what it would cost to repair or 
replace the damaged property. 

Sometimes there may be a disagreement as to the amount of money we 
owe for losses or damage to an auto. If so, Massachusetts law provides 
for a method of settling the disagreement. Either you or we can, within 60 
days after you file your proof of loss, demand in writing that appraisers be 
selected. The appraisers must then follow a procedure set by law to 
establish the amount of damage. Their decision will be binding on you and 
us. You and we must share the cost of the appraisal. 

12. 
Sales Tax Under Collision, Limited Collision and Comprehensive (Parts 7, 8 and 9) 
we will pay, subject to your deductible, all sales taxes applicable to the loss 
of an auto or damage to an auto. 
13. Secured Lenders 
When your Coverage Selections Page shows that a lender has a secured 
interest in your auto, we will make payments under Collision, Limited 
Collision and Comprehensive (Parts 7, 8 and 9) according to the legal 
interests of each party. 
The secured lenders right of payment will not be invalidated by your acts 
or neglect except that we will not pay if the loss of or damage to your auto 
is the result of conversion, embezzlement, or secretion by you or any 
household member. Also, we will not pay the secured lender if the loss of 
or damage to your auto is the result of arson, theft or any other means of 
disposal committed by you or at your direction. 

When we pay any secured lender we shall, to the extent of our payment 
have the right to exercise any of the secured lenders legal rights of 
recovery. If you do not file a proof of loss as provided in this policy, the 
secured lender must do so within 30 days after the loss or damage 
becomes known to the secured lender.

General Provisions 
And Exclusions 
(Continued)

secured lender as provided in this policy. 

14. No Benefits Coverage under Collision, Limited Collision and Comprehensive 
To Anyone In (Parts 7, 8 and 9) shall not in any way benefit any person or organi- 
The Auto Business zation having possession of your auto for the purpose of servicing, 
repairing, parking, storing, or transporting it or for any similar purpose. 

15. If Two Or More Two or more autos may be insured under this policy. There may be 
Autos Are Insured different limits for each auto. If so, when someone covered under 
Under This Policy this policy is injured while a pedestrian or is using an auto other than 
your auto at the time of the accident, the most we will pay under any 
applicable Part is the highest limit shown for that Part for any one auto on 
your Coverage Selections Page. 

16. 
Trailers When a trailer is attached to an auto we consider the auto and trailer 
together to be one auto in applying the limits shown on the Coverage 
Selections Page under Bodily Injury To Others, Damage To Someone 
Elses Property and Optional Bodily Injury To Others (Parts 1, 4 and 5). 
17. Premiums The premium we will charge for any extension or renewal of this 
For Extensions policy will be in accordance with our rates and rules in effect at the 
Or Renewals time of the effective date of the extension or renewal. 
18. False 
If you or someone on your behalf gives us false, deceptive, mis- 
Information 
leading or incomplete information in any application or policy change 
request and if such false, deceptive, misleading or incomplete information 
increases our risk of loss, we may refuse to pay claims under any or all of 
the Optional Insurance Parts of this policy. Such information includes the 
description and the place of garaging of the vehicles to be insured, the 
names of all household members and customary operators required to 
be listed and the answers given for all listed operators. We may also limit 
our payments to those amounts that we are required to sell under Part 3 
and Part 4 of this policy. 

19. Changes Which 
If the information contained in your application changes before this 
Affect Premium 
policy expires, we have the right to adjust your premium to reflect such 
changes. 

20. Pre-Insurance 
Massachusetts law requires that we inspect certain motor vehicles 
Inspection 
before providing coverage for Collision, Limited Collision, or Com- 
prehensive (Parts 7, 8 or 9). In some cases, we may defer the required 
inspection of your auto for seven calendar days (not including legal 
holidays) following the effective date of coverage. 
If you do not have your auto inspected within the time allowed, coverage 
for that auto will be automatically suspended. Your premium will be 
adjusted if the suspension lasts for more than ten days. 


Cancellation 
and Renewal 


29 

Cancellation 
Cancellation of this policy is something you should ordinarily have no 
reason to worry about. 

You can cancel any of the Optional Insurance Parts at any time by giving 
us or your agent at least twenty days written notice. Because all of the 
Compulsory Insurance Parts are required, you cannot cancel any of them 
separately. You can, of course, cancel all of the Compulsory Insurance 
Parts by giving us or your agent at least twenty days written notice. 

We can cancel all of any part of this policy including your Compulsory 
Insurance if: 

1. You have not paid your premium on this policy. 
2. We find that you were responsible for fraud or material misrepresentation 
when you applied for this policy or any extension or renewal of it. 
3. Your drivers license or auto registration has been under suspension or 
revocation during the policy period. 
We can cancel Collision (Part 7) and Comprehensive (Part 9) on a vehicle: 

1. customarily driven by or owned by persons who have within the last five 
years been convicted of vehicular homicide, auto related fraud, or auto 
theft, or 
2. customarily driven by or owned by persons who have within the last five 
years made an intentional and material misrepresentation in making claim 
under those coverages, or 
3. customarily driven or owned by persons who have within the last three 
years, been convicted of any category of driving under the influence of 
alcohol or drugs, or 
4. for which a salvage title has been issued by the Registrar of Motor 
Vehicles unless a new certificate of title has been issued in accordance 
with Massachusetts law, or 
5. designated as a high-theft vehicle which does not have at least a 
minimum anti-theft or auto recovery device as prescribed by the 
Commissioner of Insurance. 
We may likewise cancel: 

1. Collision (Part 7) on a vehicle customarily driven by or owned by 
persons who, within three years preceding the effective date of this policy, 
have been involved in four or more at-fault auto accidents. An

And Renewal 
(Continued) 

at-fault is one in which you or any person who customarily drives your 
auto was more than 50% at fault; and . 

2. Comprehensive (Part 9) on a vehicle customarily driven by or 
owned by persons who have two or more total auto theft or fire 
insurance claims within the three years immediately preceding the 
effective date of this policy. 
If the drivers license or auto registration of anyone residing in your 
household who usually operates your auto has been under sus-
pension or revocation during the policy period, we may suspend 
coverage for that person under any of the Optional Insurance Parts of 
the policy. We may also reduce the limits available for that person 
under Bodily Injury Caused By An Uninsured Auto (Part 3), Damage 
To Someone Elses Property (Part 4) to the minimum limits we are 
required to sell. 

We can cancel Towing And Labor (Part 11) for reasons other than 
those listed above if we do so within the first 90 days of the policy 
period. We can cancel, in the same manner, coverage limits which are 
higher than the limits we are required by law to sell you and any 
coverages designed to reduce the deductibles set by law. 

Automatic Massachusetts law provides that your policy automatically termi-
Termination nates and a Notice of Cancellation will not be sent to you when: 

1. You return the registration plates for your auto to the Registry of 
Motor Vehicles. 
2. You purchase a new policy with another company covering your 
auto and a new Certificate of Insurance is filed with the Registry of 
Motor Vehicles. 
3. You transfer title to your auto, and you do not register another 
auto. In this case, the policy will terminate 30 days from the date of 
transfer of title. 
However, if more than one auto is described on the Coverage 
Selections Page, the termination of coverage applies only to the auto 
involved in any of the situations described above. 

Legal Notice Any notice of cancellation will be sent to you at your last address 
Requirement shown on the Coverage Selections Page at least 20 days prior to the 


 Cancellation 
And Renewal 
(Continued) 

31 

effective date. A notice sent by regular mail for which a certificate of 
mailing receipt has been obtained from the United States Postal 
Service, will be considered sufficient notice. 

In order for us to cancel the rights of any secured lender shown on the 
Coverage Selections Page, a notice of cancellation must also be sent 
to the secured lender in a similar manner. 

If we cancel this policy in its entirety, the cancellation is not effective 
unless we send the required notice to the Registry of Motor Vehicles. 

If we cancel, the amount of your refund will be determined by a pro 
rata table based on the number of days the policy was in effect. 
If the policy is cancelled by you or by law, you will get a refund which 
is less than proportional to the time involved. It will be based instead 
on a short rate table which compensates us for our expenses in 
servicing your policy. 

No refund of premium will be sent to you upon cancellation of the 
policy until we receive a receipt showing that the registration plates 
assigned to the insured motor vehicle have been returned to the 
Registry of Motor Vehicles or other document showing that you have 
replaced the insurance required by law. 

If you think that we have cancelled your policy illegally, you can 
appeal to the Board of Appeals on Motor Vehicle Liability Policies and 
Bonds. Your cancellation notice will explain how to appeal. 

Renewal 
If we decide not to renew this policy or any of its Parts, we must mail 
our notice to your agent or to you at your last address shown on the 
Coverage Selections Page at least 45 days before your policy runs 
out. A notice sent by regular mail for which a certificate of mailing 
receipt has been obtained from the United States Postal Service will 
be considered sufficient notice. If we require a renewal application, 
and you fail to complete and return it to us within the specified time, 
we then have the right to cancel the renewal policy.

What Insurance is Required by Law 

 

If you own an automobile that is operated on a highway in Ontario, certain insurance coverages are required 
by law. You may also choose to buy additional insurance to extend these coverages to protect against other 
risks. The chart below is only a general summary to give you an idea of the insurance coverages available 
to you. For details of each coverage and the conditions that apply, you should consult the appropriate sections 
of the policy. If there is a difference between the information in this chart and the appropriate section of the 
policy, the section of the policy prevails. 

 

You only have a specific coverage if your Certificate of Automobile Insurance shows a premium for it 
or it is provided at no cost. If you have insured more than one automobile, a premium must be shown 
for each automobile.

Section 1 



 

Introduction 

 

1.1 This Policy is Part of a Contract 


 

This policy is part of a contract between you and us. The contract includes three documents: 

. a completed and signed Application for Automobile Insurance, 
. a Certificate of Automobile Insurance, and 
. this policy. 


Under the contract, we agree to provide you with the insurance that is summarized on your Certificate 
of Automobile Insurance, and for which you have agreed to pay a premium. 

 

You only have a particular coverage for a specific automobile if your Certificate of 
Automobile Insurance shows a premium for it or shows the coverage is provided at no cost. 



 

1.2 Where You Are Covered 


 

 This policy covers you and other insured persons for incidents occurring in Canada, the United States 
of America and any other jurisdiction designated in the Statutory Accident Benefits Schedule, and on 
a vessel travelling between ports of those countries. All of the dollar limits described in this policy are 
in Canadian funds. 

1.3 Definitions 


 

Automobile 

In this policy, motorized snow vehicle is included in the definition of automobile. 
Regulations may include, or exclude, certain other types or classes of vehicles as automobiles. 

In this policy, there is a difference between a described automobile and the automobile. 
When we refer to an automobile as described, we mean any automobile specifically shown on 
the Certificate of Automobile Insurance. 


When we refer to the automobile, we mean: 

. a described automobile, 
. a newly acquired automobile, 
. a temporary substitute automobile, 
. other automobiles driven by you, or driven by your spouse who lives with you, or 
. trailers, in certain circumstances. 


 

These types of automobiles are described more fully in Section 2. 

 

Certificate of Automobile Insurance 

A Certificate of Automobile Insurance is a written document summarizing your insurance 
coverage. It shows your name and/or organization, and the described automobile or 
automobiles. It lists the coverages purchased, premiums charged, and the period during which 
the insurance is in effect. 

Covered/Coverage 

When we talk of someone or something being covered, we mean that they are protected by 
insurance. When we speak of coverage, we are describing what types of protection they have 
and how much for each type. 

Direct Loss or Damage 

Direct loss or damage refers to damage or loss caused directly by a peril. This is different 
than an indirect loss. For example, damage to an automobile resulting from a collision is a 
direct loss. Loss of the use of an automobile while it is being repaired is an indirect loss. 

Excluded Driver 

An excluded driver is someone specifically not covered by this policy when driving the 
described, temporary substitute or newly acquired automobile(s). The only exception is 
coverage for those Accident Benefits the law requires to be paid to anyone injured in an 
automobile accident in Ontario. 

Named Insured 

The named insured is the person or organization to whom the Certificate of Automobile 
Insurance is issued. 

Occupant 

In this policy, an occupant is a person, including the driver, in or on an automobile, or getting 
into, on, out of, or off an automobile. 


Proof of Loss Form 

A proof of loss form records the formal statement concerning a loss for which a claim is 
submitted. It provides us with all the information we need to determine whether the claim is 
reasonable and the extent of our liability. 

Spouse 

Spouse means either of two persons who: 

. are married to each other; 
. have together entered into a marriage that is voidable or void, in good faith on the part 
of the person making a claim under this policy; or 
. have lived together in a conjugal relationship outside marriage, 
o continuously for a period of not less than three years, or 
o in a relationship of some permanence, if they are the natural or adoptive parents 
of a child. 




We and You 

Throughout this policy the words you and your refer to the person or organization shown on 
the Certificate of Automobile Insurance as the named insured. 

Other people may also be covered under certain conditions. We call both them and you 
insured persons. 

We, our and us mean the company providing the insurance. 

 

1.4 Your Responsibilities 


 

If you fail to meet your responsibilities, claims under this policy, with the 
exception of certain Accident Benefits, may be denied. 



 

By accepting this contract you agree to the following conditions. 

 

1.4.1 You agree to notify us promptly in writing of any significant change of which you are 
aware in your status as a driver, owner or lessee of a described automobile. You also 
agree to let us know of any change that might increase the risk of an incident or affect our 
willingness to insure you at current rates. 






You must promptly tell us of any change in information supplied in your original 
application for insurance, such as additional drivers, or a change in the way a described 
automobile is used. 

1.4.2 You agree to inform us of any sale or transfer of your interest in a described automobile 
except through change of title by succession, death or proceedings under the Bankruptcy 
and Insolvency Act (Canada). 







1.4.3 If you have purchased optional Loss or Damage Coverages, you agree to inform us of any 
new lien (an interest by others), mortgage or loan that affects a described automobile, as 
well as any other insurance against loss or damage. 
1.4.4 When you are involved in an auto accident involving injury or property damage, you need 
to report it to your insurance agent, broker, or insurance company within seven days, 
regardless of who is at fault. If you are unable to report the accident within seven days, 
report it as soon as possible after that. 
1.4.5 You agree not to drive or operate the automobile, or allow anyone else to drive or operate 
the automobile, when not authorized by law. 
1.4.6 You agree not to use or allow anyone to use the automobile in a race or speed test or for 
any illegal trade or transportation. 
1.4.7 You agree to permit us to inspect the automobile and its equipment at all reasonable times. 




1.5 Where to Make A Claim and Who May Make It 


 

Warning  Offences 

It is an offence under the Insurance Act to knowingly make a false or 
misleading statement or representation to an insurer in connection with the 
persons entitlement to a benefit under a contract of insurance, or to 
wilfully fail to inform the insurer of a material change in circumstances 
within 14 days, in connection with such entitlement. The offence is 
punishable on conviction by a maximum fine of $250,000 for the first 
offence and a maximum fine of $500,000 for any subsequent conviction. 

It is an offence under the federal Criminal Code for anyone to knowingly 
make or use a false document with the intent it be acted on as genuine and 
the offence is punishable, on conviction, by a maximum of 10 years 
imprisonment. 

It is an offence under the federal Criminal Code for anyone, by deceit, 
falsehood, or other dishonest act, to defraud or to attempt to defraud an 
insurance company. The offence is punishable, on conviction, by a 
maximum of 14 years imprisonment for cases involving an amount over 
$5,000 or otherwise a maximum of 2 years imprisonment. 



 

You or other insured persons must notify us of a claim and provide proof of the claim. This may be 
done in person or by registered mail addressed to our chief agent or head office in Ontario. 

If you or other insured persons are unable to notify us or complete any required document for good 
reason, someone may act on your behalf. 

If you or other insured persons refuse, or are unable, to complete any required document, anyone to 
whom any part of the insurance money is payable may do so instead. 

 

 


1.6 Our Rights and Responsibilities 


 

1.6.1 Payment of Claims 






 

We will pay legitimate claims within 60 days of receiving a proof of loss. Some claims 
for Accident Benefits will be paid sooner. 

If we refuse to pay a claim, we will notify the insured person in writing explaining the 
reasons why we are not liable to pay. 

 

1.6.2 If You Have Been Incorrectly Classified and Your Premium is Wrong 






 

We use rules that determine the amount you pay for each coverage and category of 
automobile insurance. You are classified according to these rules. 

 

If you have been incorrectly classified, we will correct the situation. 

 

If the incorrect classification resulted in your paying too high a premium, we will refund 
any premium overpayment with interest. The interest will cover the period for which you 
were overcharged. 

 

The rate of interest will be the bank rate, as set by the Bank of Canada, on the first day of 
the last month of the quarter preceding the quarter in which you were incorrectly 
classified. If the bank rate includes a fraction we will round it off to the next highest 
number. (The bank rate is the rate at which the Bank of Canada makes short-term loans to 
chartered banks.) 

 

If the incorrect classification resulted in your paying too low a premium, we will require 
you to pay an additional premium as long as we tell you within 60 days of the effective 
date of the policy. We will not charge you interest on the additional premium. 

 

1.6.3 Monthly Premium Payment Option 






 

The law may allow you to pay your premium in equal monthly payments. If so, we may 
charge you interest at a rate determined by the provincial government under the Insurance 
Act (Ontario). 


 

1.7 Cancelling Your Insurance 


 

1.7.1 When You Cancel 


 

You may cancel your insurance at any time by advising us. 

 

If you cancel, we will calculate the premium you owe on a short rate basis. Short rate 
means that the premium you owe will include our handling costs. We will refund 
anything due to you as soon as possible. 

 

There may be a minimum premium set out in your Certificate of Automobile Insurance. 
This will not be refunded. 

 

1.7.2 When We Cancel 






 

Where your policy has been in effect for up to 60 days, we may only cancel your policy 
for a reason that we have filed with the Financial Services Commission of Ontario. 

 

Where your policy has been in effect for more than 60 days, we may only cancel your 
policy for one of the following reasons: 

 

. non-payment of premium, 
. you have given false particulars of the automobile to our prejudice, 
. you have knowingly misrepresented or failed to disclose information that you were 
required to provide in the application for automobile insurance, or 
. the risk has changed materially. 


 

If we cancel your policy, we will calculate the premium you owe on a proportionate basis. 
Proportionate means you will pay for the actual number of days you were covered. For 
example, if half the premium period is over, you will pay half the premium. 

 

There may be a minimum premium shown on your Certificate of Automobile Insurance. 
This will not be refunded. 

 

If you have paid more than the premium you owe, we will refund the difference on 
cancellation. Your refund may be delayed if the amount of premium you owe is subject to 
adjustment, or we are waiting for reports in order to determine the premium paid or owing. 
We will make the refund as soon as possible in that case. 


 

1.7.3 How We Can Cancel for Non-payment of Premium 






 

In case of non-payment of premium, we may give you a notice in writing. We must give 
you ten days notice if we deliver the notice in person, or 30 days notice by sending the 
notice by registered mail to your last known address. The 30-day period starts on the 
second day after we mail the registered letter. The notice will inform you that you have 
until noon of the business day before the last day of the notice period to pay the arrears, 
plus an administration fee, failing which the policy will automatically be cancelled 
effective at 12:01 a.m. on the last day of the notice period. If you pay the arrears and the 
administration fee in time, then your policy will not be cancelled. 

 

But if we have already given you two notices of non-payment of premium during the term 
of your policy and a non-payment occurs again, we dont have to give you another notice 
under this section; instead we may cancel your policy as described in section 1.7.4. 

 

1.7.4 How We Can Cancel for Repeated Non-payment or Other Reasons 






 

If we cancel your insurance for non-payment of premium because we have already given 
you two notices during the term of your policy as described in section 1.7.3, or if we 
cancel for any other reason, we will notify you in writing. We must give you five days 
notice if we deliver the notice of cancellation in person, or 15 days notice by sending the 
notice of cancellation by registered mail to your last known address. The 15-day period 
starts on the second day after we mail the registered letter. If the notice was given because 
we have already given you two notices of non-payment during the term of your policy as 
described in section 1.7.3, we are under no obligation to accept a late payment or to keep 
the policy in force after the effective date of cancellation. 


 

 

1.8 Who and What We Won't Cover 


 

1.8.1 General Exclusion 


 

Except for certain Accident Benefits coverage, there is no coverage under this policy if: 

 

. the automobile is used to carry explosives or radioactive material; or 
. the automobile is used as a taxicab, bus, a sightseeing conveyance or to carry 
paying passengers. However, we don't consider the following as situations 
involving carrying paying passengers: 


 

o giving a ride to someone in return for a ride, 
o sharing the cost of an occasional trip with others in the automobile, 
o carrying a domestic worker hired by you or your spouse, 
o occasionally carrying children to or from school activities that are 
conducted within the educational program,

including gas, vehicle wear and tear and meals. 




 

1.8.2 Excluded Drivers and Driving Without Permission 


 

Except for certain Accident Benefits coverage, there is no coverage (including coverage 
for occupants) under this policy if the automobile is used or operated by a person in 
possession of the automobile without the owners consent or is driven by a person named 
as an excluded driver of the automobile policy or a person who, at the time he or she 
willingly becomes an occupant of an automobile, knows or ought reasonably to know that 
the automobile is being used or operated by a person in possession of the automobile 
without the owners consent. 

 

Except for certain Accident Benefits coverage, there is no coverage under this policy for a 
person who, at the time he or she willingly becomes an occupant of an automobile, knows 
or ought reasonably to know that the automobile is being used or operated by a person in 
possession of the automobile without the owners consent. 

 

1.8.3 Rented or Leased Automobile 


 

Except for certain Accident Benefits coverage, there is no coverage under this policy if 
the automobile is rented or leased by you to another. However, if an insured person is 
using the automobile for an employer's business and is paid for using it, we won't consider 
that renting or leasing. 


 

1.8.4 Garage Workers Not Covered 


 

No person who sells, repairs, maintains, stores, services, or parks automobiles as part of a 
business is covered by this policy while involved in conducting that business, unless the 
person in fact owns the automobile involved in an incident or is the partner or employee of 
the owner. 

 

1.8.5 Losses Due to War Activities Not Covered 


 

With the exception of Liability Coverage, this policy does not cover loss, damage, injury 
or death caused by war activities. War activities include bombardment, invasion, civil 
war, insurrection, rebellion, revolution, coup, or actions of armed forces while engaged in 
a war, whether declared or not. 

 

Other restrictions apply to specific coverages, such as Accident Benefits and 
optional Loss or Damage coverages. These additional restrictions will be described 
in the appropriate Sections of this policy.

2.2.1 Newly Acquired Automobiles 


 

A newly acquired automobile is an automobile or trailer that you acquire as owner and 
that is not covered under any other policy. It can be either a replacement or an additional 
automobile. The replacement automobile will have the same coverage as the described 
automobile it replaces. We will cover an additional automobile as long as: 

 

. we insure all automobiles you own, and 
. any claim you make for the additional automobile is made against a coverage we 
provide for all your other automobiles. 


 

Your newly acquired automobile(s) will be insured as long as you inform us within 14 
days from the time of delivery and pay any additional premium required. 

 

We may inspect the newly acquired vehicle and its equipment at any reasonable time. 

 

Special Condition: Coverage is not extended to a newly acquired automobile if you 
are in the business of selling automobiles. 

 

2.2.2 Temporary Substitute Automobile 


 

A temporary substitute automobile is an automobile that is temporarily used while a 
described automobile is out of service. The described automobile must not be in use by 
anyone insured by this policy, because of its breakdown, repair, servicing, theft, sale or 
destruction. 

 

Coverage for a temporary substitute automobile is provided under the automobile policy 
of the owner of the temporary substitute automobile. However, this policy may also 
provide coverage. 

 

The following coverages apply to a temporary substitute automobile if a premium is 
shown for them on the Certificate of Automobile Insurance for the described automobile 
that is temporarily out of service: 

 

. Liability, 
. Accident Benefits, 
. Uninsured Automobile, and 
. Direct Compensation - Property Damage 



If you have purchased optional Loss or Damage Coverages on a described automobile 
and it is temporarily out of service, there are special conditions about this coverage for 
temporary substitute automobiles. These conditions are explained in Section 7 - Loss or 
Damage Coverages of this policy. 

 

Special Condition: A temporary substitute automobile cannot be owned by you or by 
anyone living in the same dwelling as you. 

 

2.2.3 Other Automobiles 


 

Automobiles, other than a described automobile, are also covered when driven by you, or 
driven by your spouse who lives with you. 

 

The following coverages apply to other automobiles if a premium is shown for the 
coverage on the Certificate of Automobile Insurance for a described automobile: 

 

. Liability, 
. Accident Benefits, 
. Uninsured Automobile, and 
. Direct Compensation - Property Damage 


 

Special Conditions: For other automobiles to be covered, the following conditions 
apply: 

 

1. Both the other automobile and a described automobile must not have a 
manufacturers gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR) of more than 4,500 kilograms. 
2. The named insured is an individual, or if the described automobile is owned by two 
people, the named insureds are spouses of each other. 
3. Neither you nor your spouse is driving the other automobile in connection with the 
business of selling, repairing, maintaining, storing, servicing or parking 
automobiles. 
4. The other automobile is not being used to carry paying passengers or to make 
commercial deliveries at the time of any loss. 
5. For all coverages, except Accident Benefits, the other automobile cannot be an 
automobile that you or anyone living in your dwelling owns or regularly uses. (For 
the purposes of this paragraph, we dont consider use of an automobile rented for 
30 or fewer days to be regular use.) Nor can the other automobile be owned, hired 
or leased by your employer or the employer of anyone living in your household. 
However, if you drive one of these other automobiles while an excluded driver 
under the policy for that automobile, this policy will provide Liability and 
Uninsured Automobile Coverages while you drive that automobile. 


 


6. If you are a corporation, unincorporated association, partnership, sole 
proprietorship, business or other entity, the employee or partner for whose 
regular use a described automobile is supplied, and their spouse who lives with that 
person, will be covered when they drive the other automobile, under the following 
conditions:

manufacturers gross vehicle weight rating of more than 4,500 kilograms.

make commercial deliveries at the time of any loss. 
. The other automobile must not be owned, hired, leased, or regularly or

employee or partner or their spouse if they own, lease or rent any 
automobile and it is insured as the law requires and does not have a 
manufacturers gross vehicle weight rating of more than 4,500 kilograms 
7. For Direct Compensation - Property Damage Coverage the other automobile 
cannot be a described automobile in a motor vehicle liability policy. 


 

2.2.4 Other Automobiles that are Rented or Leased 


 

For convenience in this subsection we use the terms rented and renting as equivalent to 
leased and leasing. 

 

In addition to the coverages referred to in subsection 2.2.3, the following coverage applies 
to rented automobiles if a premium is shown for the coverage on the Certificate of 
Automobile Insurance for a described automobile: 

 

. Liability. 


 

Automobiles, other than a described automobile, are covered as described in this 
subsection when rented by you, or by your spouse who lives with you, for periods of not 
more than 30 days, but only with respect to the liability of the person renting the 
automobile arising from the negligence of the driver of that automobile, and only if the 
driver is not an excluded driver under this policy. 

 

Special Conditions: For rented automobiles to be covered, the following conditions 
apply: 

 


1. Both the rented automobile and the described automobile must not have a 
manufacturers gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR) of more than 4,500

example to move you or a family member from one residence to another; or for 
travel or other recreational use), and only if it is rented for no more than 7 days. 
2. The named insured is an individual, or if the described automobile is owned by 
two people, the named insureds are spouses of each other. 
3. Neither you nor your spouse is renting the other automobile in connection with the 
business of selling, repairing, maintaining, storing, servicing or parking 
automobiles. 
4. The rented automobile is not being used to carry paying passengers or to make 
commercial deliveries at the time of any loss. 
5. The rented automobile cannot be an automobile that you or anyone living in your 
dwelling owns or regularly uses. Nor can the rented automobile be owned, hired or 
leased by your employer or the employer of anyone living in your household. For 
the purposes of this paragraph, we dont consider use of an automobile rented for 
30 or fewer days to be regular use. 
6. If you are a corporation, unincorporated association, partnership, sole 
proprietorship, business or other entity, the employee or partner for whose 
regular use a described automobile is supplied, and their spouse who lives with that 
person, will be covered when they rent an automobile, under the following 
conditions: 
. Both the rented automobile and the described automobile must not have a 
manufacturers gross vehicle weight rating of more than 4,500 kilograms. 
. Neither the employee nor partner who is provided with a described

renting the automobile in connection with the business of selling, 
repairing, maintaining, storing, servicing or parking automobiles. 
. The rented automobile is not being used to carry paying passengers or to 
make commercial deliveries at the time of any loss. 
2.2.5 Trailers 


 

Any trailer used in connection with the automobile is insured for the following 
coverages: 

 

. Liability, 
. Accident Benefits, and 
. Uninsured Automobile. 


 


Special Conditions: Any trailer you own and that is not described in this policy is also 
covered for Direct Compensation - Property Damage Coverage under the following 
conditions: 

 

. If it is attached to an automobile with a GVWR of not more than 4,500 kilograms, 
or if not attached, it is normally used with an automobile with a GVWR of not 
more than 4,500 kilograms. 


 

. It is not designed or used for living in, to carry passengers, or for commercial 
purposes. 


 

2.3 When You Have Insured Two Or More Automobiles 


 

2.3.1 Under the Same Policy 


 

When more than one automobile is described on your Certificate of Automobile Insurance, 
we will treat each automobile as if it were insured by a separate policy for claims resulting 
from its use or operation. 

 

However, in the case of an incident involving an automobile you don't own, we will only 
pay up to the highest limit that applies to any one automobile described in this policy. 

 

Example 

 

Your automobile policy has Liability Coverage on two automobiles for $300,000 and 
$500,000 respectively. If you are driving someone else's automobile and are involved 
in an accident, the most we would pay is $500,000. 



 

2.3.2 Under More Than One Policy 


 

When you have two or more automobiles insured as described automobiles under two or 
more policies, each automobile will be covered by its respective policy. 

 

However, determining how much we will pay is more complicated if there is an incident in 
an automobile you don't own. 

 

The amount we will pay under this policy for any incident will be a fraction of the highest 
policy limit. This fraction will be the proportion that the limit under this policy bears to 
the total of the limits of all the policies. 

 

In no case will we pay more than this proportion of the highest limit. 

 

 

 


Example 

 

You have an automobile with Liability Coverage for $200,000 under this policy 
(Policy A) and another automobile with Liability Coverage for $300,000 under a 
separate policy (Policy B). If you have an accident while driving an automobile you 
don't own, here is how we will calculate the amount we will pay. 

 

Step 1. What is the total of the limits of all the policies? 

 

 200,000 (limit under Policy A) 

+ 300,000 (limit under Policy B) 

 500,000 (total under both policies) 



 

Step 2. What is the proportion of the limit under Policy A to the total from Step 1? 

 

 200,000 (limit under Policy A) = 2 

 500,000 (total under both policies) 5 



 

Step 3. What is the most we will pay under this policy? 

 

 2 x 300,000 (highest policy limit) = 120,000 

 5 



 

The most we would pay would be 2/5 of the loss, but never more than $120,000, 2/5 
of the highest policy limit. The other policy will pay the remaining 3/5 of the loss to 
a maximum of $180,000. 



 

2.4 Trailers and Towing 


 

2.4.1 Trailers 


 

An automobile pulling one or more trailers will be treated as a single automobile when 
determining how much we will pay under Liability, Accident Benefits and Uninsured 
Automobile Coverages. However, they will be treated as separate automobiles when 
determining the deductibles and how much we will pay under Direct Compensation - 
Property Damage and optional Loss or Damage Coverages. 

 

2.4.2 Automobiles in Tow 


 

We may inspect the automobile at any reasonable time. If you do not co-operate in any 
incident involving two or more automobiles owned by different persons and attached to each 
other, the insurer of each automobile will compensate its insured for losses according to the 
terms of the Direct Compensation - Property Damage and optional Loss or Damage 
coverages. 

 


2.5 Inspection 


 

We may inspect the automobile at any reasonable time. If you do not co-operate with any reasonable 
arrangements for inspection, your optional Loss or Damage Coverages under Section 7 may be 
cancelled and any claims under that Section may be denied. 


 

Section 3 



 

Liability Coverage 

 

You only have a particular coverage for a specific automobile if your Certificate 
of Automobile Insurance shows a premium for it or shows the coverage is 
provided at no cost. 



 

3.1 Introduction 


 

This Section of your policy provides coverage for amounts that the law holds you or other insured 
persons responsible for bodily injuries or losses others suffer in an automobile incident. 

 

3.2 Who is Covered 


 

You are covered when you, or anyone else in possession of a described automobile with your consent, 
uses or operates it. We will consider these other people insured persons. 

 

Your Liability Coverage applies when you or others use or operate certain other 
types of automobiles. See Section 2 for details and additional conditions. 



 

3.3 What We Cover 


 

You or other insured persons may be legally responsible for the bodily injury to, or death of others, or 
for damage to the property of others as a result of owning, leasing or operating the automobile or 
renting or leasing another automobile. In these cases, we will make any payment on your or other 
insured persons' behalf that the law requires, up to the limits of the policy. 

 

We will also reimburse anyone covered by this policy for costs involved in providing immediate 
medical aid needed by someone hurt in an automobile incident. 

 

When we receive notice of loss or damage caused to persons or property we will investigate. We may 
then negotiate a settlement on behalf of you or other insured persons. 

 

3.3.1 If Someone Sues You 


 

By accepting this policy you and other insured persons irrevocably appoint us to act on your or 
their behalf in any lawsuit against you or them in Canada, the United States of America or any 
other jurisdiction designated in the Statutory Accident Benefits Schedule arising out of the 
ownership, use or operation of the automobile. 

 


If someone sues you or other insured persons insured by this Section for losses suffered in an 
automobile incident, we will provide a defence and cover the costs of that defence, including 
investigation costs. We will pay all legal costs the court assesses against you and other insured 
persons in the lawsuit we have defended. 

 

If there is a judgment against you or other insured persons, we will pay any post-judgment 
interest owed on that part of the amount the court orders that falls within the liability limits of 
your policy. 

 

We reserve the right to investigate, negotiate and settle any claim out of court if we choose. 

 

If you are sued for more than the limits of your policy, you may wish to hire, at your 
cost, your own lawyer to protect yourself against the additional risk. 



 

3.3.2 How Much We Will Pay 


 

The most we will pay on your behalf and on behalf of all other insured persons insured by this 
Section, for any one incident (over and above legal costs and post-judgment interest) will be 
determined by the extent of your coverage. The limit under your policy is shown on the 
Certificate of Automobile Insurance. 

 

Example 

 

You are sued for injuries suffered by another person in an accident that you are 
legally responsible for. We will hire lawyers at our expense and cover all costs of 
your defence in court. 

 

The court orders you to pay $10,000 in costs and $600,000 to cover losses. Your 
liability limit is $500,000. 

 

We will cover the $10,000 in costs, and $500,000 of the judgment. We will also pay 
any interest owed on that amount from the day of the judgment. You will be 
responsible for the remaining $100,000 of the judgment and any interest owed on 
that. 



 


 

3.3.3 Outside Ontario 


 

If the incident happens in a jurisdiction covered by this policy in which the minimum liability 
coverage required is higher than the limit shown on the Certificate of Automobile Insurance, 
we will honour the higher amount. We also agree not to use any legal defence that would not 
be available if the policy had been issued in that jurisdiction. 

 

Example 

 

You have an accident in a province where the minimum liability coverage required is 
$500,000. Even though you are only carrying $200,000 worth of liability insurance, 
we will pay up to $500,000. 



 

3.3.4 If There is More Than One Named Insured Under This Policy 


 

We will protect you and others named as insured by this policy, for claims made against each 
other. In such cases, we will act as if a separate policy was issued to each named insured. 
However, the total amount we will pay (over and above legal costs and post-judgment interest) 
cannot exceed the maximum coverage shown on the Certificate of Automobile Insurance. 

 

Example 

 

Two people are in business together. Both are named in the insurance policy covering 
their van. They have bought Liability Coverage of $500,000. 

 

One day, there is an accident while one is driving and the other is a passenger. Both 
of them are severely injured as a result of their combined negligence. 

 

They sue each other and one is awarded $300,000 and the other $500,000. The 
combined amount we will pay will not be more than the policy limit of $500,000 plus 
legal costs and post-judgment interest. 



 

3.3.5 Rented and Leased Automobiles 


 

For convenience in this subsection we use the terms rent, renter and rented as equivalent to 
lease, lessee and leased. 

 

This policy provides coverage for persons who rent an automobile, as described in the 
definitions of automobile in Section 2, as a result of liability imposed by law arising from the 
negligence of the driver of that automobile. 


 

If a liability claim is made against a driver, renter or owner of a rented automobile, coverage 
may be available under more than one motor vehicle liability policy. The following rules 
govern the order in which the policies will respond: 

 

1. If insurance is available to the person who rented the automobile, the policy providing 
that insurance responds first. 
2. If insurance is available to the driver of the rented automobile, the policy providing that 
insurance responds next. 
3. If insurance is available to the owner of the rented automobile, the policy providing that 
insurance responds last. 


 

We have no liability for such claims in excess of the limit of liability coverage specified in the 
Certificate of Automobile Insurance and do not have the responsibility to defend such claims 
against anyone other than you, your spouse who lives with you, or the persons mentioned in 
subsections 2.2.3 (6) and 2.2.4 (6). 

 

Example #1* 

 

You rent a car and your friend is driving it when an accident occurs in Ontario. You, 
your friend, and the rental company may face claims by other people who have 
sustained a loss in the accident. If insurance is available to you under your policy for 
such claims and your friend was at fault for the accident, then your policy would be 
first in line to pay those people. If that coverage were used up, and if insurance is 
available to your friend under his or her policy, your friends insurer would pay next. 
If that coverage were used up, any insurance available under the rental companys 
policy would then pay. None of the insurers has to pay more than the limit of 
coverage that it agreed to provide. 



*These examples are provided as a convenience only, to illustrate the operation of section 277 of the Insurance Act (Ontario). If 
there is a discrepancy between section 277 and these examples, section 277 prevails. In addition, whether or not insurance is 
available under a policy in any given situation depends on the facts of that situation and the terms of the particular policy. 

 

Example #2* 

 

Your friend rents a car and you are driving it when an accident occurs in Ontario. 
You, your friend, and the rental company may face claims by other people who have 
sustained a loss in the accident. If you were at fault for the accident and insurance is 
available to your friend under his or her policy for such claims, then your friends 
insurer would be first in line to pay those people. If that coverage were used up, and if 
insurance is available to you under your policy, then your insurer would pay next. If 
that coverage were used up, any insurance available under the rental companys 




policy would then pay. None of the insurers has to pay more than the limit of 
coverage that it agreed to provide. 



 

3.4 Your and Other Insured Persons' Responsibilities 


 

You and other insured persons agree: 

 

. to notify us in writing within seven days of any incident involving loss or damage to persons 
or property (or, if unable because of incapacity, as soon as possible after that), giving us full 
details of the incident and any claim arising from it; 
. if requested, to give us a statutory declaration that the claim arose out of the use or operation of 
the automobile and that you or other insured persons were using, operating or responsible for 
the operation of it; 
. to help us obtain all necessary information and evidence about the incident, including the 
attendance of witnesses, and to cooperate, but not financially, in any legal actions if we ask; 
. to send immediately to us everything received in writing concerning the claim, including legal 
documents; and 
. not to assume any liability for the incident, or settle any claim, except at your or other insured 
persons' own cost, and not to interfere in any legal proceeding or in any negotiations we 
conduct to settle any claim. 


 

We may, on occasion, be required by law to make payments, even though we are not otherwise 
liable for them under this policy. If so, you or other insured persons will have to reimburse us 
upon demand for those payments. 

 

3.5 Other Limitations On Your Coverage 


 

3.5.1 Property Not Covered 


 

Under this Section, we won't cover claims for damage to property carried in or upon the 
automobile, or claims for damage to other property owned or rented by, or in the care, 
custody or control of you or other insured persons. 

 

3.5.2 Contamination of Property 


 

Under this Section, we won't cover claims arising from contamination of property carried 
in the automobile. 

 

 

 

 

 


3.5.3 Nuclear Hazards 


 

Nuclear energy hazards means radioactive, toxic, explosive or other hazardous properties 
of substances described in Regulations made under the Nuclear Safety and Control Act 
(Canada). 

 

If you or other insured persons are involved in an incident where the loss or damage is 
directly or indirectly caused by a nuclear hazard, we will pay up to $200,000 if you or 
other insured persons are covered under this policy for a nuclear hazard and you and 
other insured persons are also insured under a nuclear energy hazard liability policy. We 
will only pay after the limits of that policy have been paid out. 


 

Section 4 



 

Accident Benefits Coverage 

 

You only have a particular coverage for a specific automobile if your Certificate 
of Automobile Insurance shows a premium for it or shows the coverage is 
provided at no cost. 



 

4.1 Who is Covered 


 

For the purposes of Section 4, insured persons are defined in the Statutory Accident Benefits 
Schedule. In addition, insured persons also include any person who is injured or killed in an 
automobile accident involving the automobile and is not the named insured, or the spouse or 
dependant of a named insured, under any other motor vehicle liability policy, and is not covered under 
the policy of an automobile in which they were an occupant or which struck them. 

 

4.2 Types and Benefits 


 

The details of the Accident Benefits Coverage are set out in the Statutory Accident Benefits 
Schedule of the Insurance Act (Ontario). This Section outlines the benefits that you and other 
insured persons may be entitled to receive if injured or killed in an automobile accident. If there is a 
difference between the interpretation of the wording in this Section and the interpretation of the 
wording in the Statutory Accident Benefits Schedule, the Statutory Accident Benefits Schedule 
prevails. 

 

Your insurance company is obligated to inform you and other insured persons about the 
benefits available. 

 

The benefits in the Statutory Accident Benefits Schedule are: 

 

Income Replacement Benefit 

 

This benefit may compensate you and other insured persons for lost income. 

 

Caregiver Benefit 

 

This benefit may provide compensation for some expenses incurred if an insured person has been 
catastrophically injured and cannot continue as the main caregiver for a member of the household 
who is in need of care. 

 


Non-Earner Benefit 

 

This benefit may provide compensation if you and other insured persons are completely unable to 
carry on a normal life and do not qualify for an Income Replacement Benefit or Caregiver 
Benefit. 

 

Medical Benefit 

 

This benefit may pay for some medical expenses incurred when you or other insured persons are 
injured. These are expenses that are not covered by any other medical coverage plan. 

 

Rehabilitation Benefit 

 

This benefit may pay for some rehabilitation expenses incurred when you or other insured persons 
are injured. These are expenses that are not covered by any other plan. 

 

Attendant Care Benefit 

 

This benefit may compensate you and other insured persons for some of the expense of an aide or 
attendant, including transportation for an aide or attendant to accompany the insured person to 
and from medical and rehabilitation treatments. 

 

Payment of Other Expenses 

 

If you or other insured persons have been injured, this benefit may pay for some other expenses 
such as the cost of visiting an insured person during treatment or recovery, the repair or 
replacement of some items lost or damaged in the accident and some lost educational expenses. It 
may also pay for some housekeeping and home maintenance if the insured person sustains a 
catastrophic impairment. 

 

Death Benefit 

 

This benefit may pay money to some members of the family of a person who is killed. 

 

Funeral Benefit 

 

This benefit may pay for some funeral expenses. 

 

Optional Benefits

change the eligibility requirements provided in this Section. The optional benefits are: Income 
Replacement; Medical, Rehabilitation and Attendant Care; Optional Catastrophic Impairment; 
Caregiver, Housekeeping and Home Maintenance; Death and Funeral; and Dependant Care. An 
optional Indexation Benefit may be purchased, which provides that certain weekly benefit 


payments and monetary limits will be adjusted on an annual basis to reflect changes in the cost of 
living. 

 

4.3 How to Apply for Benefits 


 

4.3.1 Applying for Benefits - Procedures and Time Limits 


 

Anyone applying for Accident Benefits must tell us within 7 days of the accident or as soon 
after that as possible. We will send you or other insured persons an application for Accident 
Benefits. 

 

The person applying for the benefits must send us the completed application within 30 days of 
receiving it. 

 

You or other insured persons may still be entitled to benefits if these time limits are not met for 
good reason, but payment of the benefit may be delayed. 

 

We must pay the Income Replacement Benefit, Non-Earner Benefit, Caregiver Benefit and 
Housekeeping and Home Maintenance Benefit within 10 business days of receiving the 
complete application for those benefits. 

 

We must pay the Death Benefit, Funeral Benefit and Payment of Other Expenses within 30 
days of receiving the complete application. 

 

We must pay the Attendant Care Benefit within 10 business days of receiving a completed 
Assessment of Attendant Care Needs form. 

 

If you or another insured person is claiming the Medical Benefit or Rehabilitation Benefit, 
your doctor or another member of a regulated health profession including a social worker must 
provide us with a treatment and assessment plan or other related forms. 

 

In some cases, we can ask you or other insured persons to go for an independent assessment to 
assess your needs. 

 

We may ask you or other insured persons to provide additional information in connection with 
the claim, such as a statutory declaration as to the circumstances that gave rise to the 
application, or proof of identity. We can also ask you or other insured persons to attend an 
examination under oath in connection with entitlement to benefits, on reasonable advance 
notice and at a time and place that are convenient to the person. If the person does not 
participate as requested, benefits may be delayed or suspended. 

 

If the injuries fall within certain guidelines issued by the Superintendent of Financial Services, 
you or other insured persons may be entitled to some medical or rehabilitation treatments 
without our prior approval and before a completed application is submitted. 

 

 


4.3.2 Choosing Which Benefit to Receive 


 

If you or other insured persons qualify for more than one weekly benefit, we will notify you 
that you must choose which benefit you will receive. Your choice may be between the Income 
Replacement, Non-Earner or Caregiver Benefits. You or other insured persons will have 30 
days to make your choice. 

 

4.4 Limitations on Your Coverage 


 

You or other insured persons are not entitled to the Income Replacement Benefit, Non-Earner 
Benefit or Payment of Other Expenses if you or they: 

 

. knew, or should reasonably have known, that they were operating an automobile 
without insurance; 
. were driving an automobile while not authorized by law to drive; 
. were driving an automobile which they were specifically excluded from driving under 
this policy; 
. knowingly operated, or should reasonably have known that the automobile was 
operated, without the owner's consent; 
. made or knew about a material misrepresentation that induced us to issue this policy; 
. intentionally failed to notify us of any significant changes as required under Section 
1.4.1; or 
. were convicted of a criminal offence involving the operation of an automobile. 


 


 

Section 5 



 

Uninsured Automobile Coverage 

 

You only have a particular coverage for a specific automobile if your 
Certificate of Automobile Insurance shows a premium for it or shows the 
coverage is provided at no cost. 



 

5.1 Introduction 


 

5.1.1 Uninsured Automobile Coverage Schedule 


 

This Section of the policy describes the terms and conditions of the coverage set out in the 
Uninsured Automobile Coverage Schedule under the Insurance Act (Ontario). If there is a 
difference between the interpretation of the wording of this Section and the interpretation of the 
wording in the Schedule, the Schedule prevails. However, 5.3.3 in this Section is an addition to 
the coverage provided by the Schedule. 

 

5.1.2 What is an Uninsured Automobile? 


 

An uninsured automobile is one for which neither the owner nor driver has liability insurance to 
cover bodily injury or property damage arising out of its ownership, use or operation, or the 
insurance is not collectible. However, this does not include an automobile owned by or 
registered in the name of the insured person or their spouse. 

 

5.1.3 What is an Unidentified Automobile? 


 

An unidentified automobile is one whose owner or driver cannot be determined. 

 

5.2 What We Will Cover 


 

5.2.1 Claims by You or Other Insured Persons for Bodily Injury 


 

We will pay any amounts you or other insured persons have a legal right to recover as damages 
from the owner or driver of an uninsured or unidentified automobile for bodily injury resulting 
from an accident involving an automobile, up to the limits in this Section. 


 

5.2.2 Claims by Others for Bodily Injury or Death 


 

We will pay any amounts any person has a legal right to recover as damages from the owner or 
driver of an uninsured or unidentified automobile for bodily injury or death of an insured person 
in an accident involving an automobile, up to the limits in this Section. 

 

5.2.3 Claims for Certain Property Damage 


 

We will pay for damage to and for loss of use of the automobile or its contents, or to both, that 
you or other insured persons have a legal right to recover from the identified owner or driver of 
an uninsured automobile in an accident involving an automobile. Subject to the $300 
deductible, we will pay up to $25,000. 

 

Note: Damage to the automobile caused by an unidentified automobile is 
not covered under this Section, but optional Loss or Damage Coverages 
may be available. 



 

5.3 Claims for Bodily Injury or Death 


 

5.3.1 Who is Covered? 


 

The following are insured persons for bodily injury or death: 

 

. Any person who is an occupant of the automobile. 
. You, your spouse, and any dependent relative of you or your spouse, 
o when an occupant of an uninsured automobile, or 
o when not in an automobile, streetcar or railway vehicle if hit by an unidentified 
or uninsured automobile. 


. If you are a corporation, unincorporated association or partnership, any director, 
officer, employee or partner for whose regular use the described automobile is provided, 
their spouse, and any dependent relative of you or your spouse, 
o when occupants of an uninsured automobile; or 
o when not in an automobile, streetcar or railway vehicle if hit by an unidentified 
or uninsured automobile. 




 

Note: If the director, officer, employee or partner, or their spouse is the owner 
of an automobile that is insured, this policy does not apply. The policy of that 
automobile will provide coverage. 



 

 


5.3.2 Limitation on a Dependent Relative 


 

A dependent relative who owns an insured automobile, or who suffers bodily injury or death 
while an occupant of his or her own uninsured automobile, is not covered under this Section of 
your policy. 

 

5.3.3 If the Described Automobile is Leased or Rented 


 

If this policy has been changed to allow the rental or lease of the described automobile for more 
than 30 days, the person or organization who is the lessee of the automobile is treated as the 
named insured. 

 

5.3.4 Conditions Applying to Claims for Bodily Injury or Death 


 

A person entitled to claim compensation for the bodily injury or death of an insured person 
must: 

 

. give us written notice of the claim within 30 days of the accident or, if unable, as soon as 
possible after that. 
. provide us with as much evidence as possible in support of the claim, giving details of 
the accident and the resulting loss. This should be done within 90 days of the accident or, 
if unable, as soon as possible after that. 
. provide us with a certificate from the medical or psychological advisor of the insured 
person if we request it. The certificate must state the cause of injury or death and, if 
appropriate, the nature of the injury and how long any disability is expected to last. 
. provide us with details of any other insurance policy, other than a life insurance policy, 
under which there is a right to compensation. 


 

5.3.5 Accidents Involving Unidentified Automobiles 


 

If an unidentified automobile causes bodily injury or death to an insured person, the insured 
person or their representative must report the accident within 24 hours, or, if unable, as soon as 
possible after that, to a police officer or similar authority. 

 

You or other insured persons must give us a written statement within 30 days of the accident, or, 
if unable, as soon as possible after that, giving a detailed description of what happened. A 
representative can make the statement. The statement must say whether the accident was caused 
by someone whose identity cannot be determined. It must also detail the extent of the injuries 
suffered by you or other insured persons and any property damaged in the accident. The 
automobile in which you or other insured persons were an occupant at the time of the accident 
must be available for inspection at our request. 

 

 

 


5.3.6 Medical Examinations May Be Required 


 

You or other insured persons may be required to undergo examinations by a qualified medical 
or psychological advisor at reasonable intervals. When we require an examination, we will give 
reasonable notice. 

 

We will pay for any examination we require. The person making the claim, or their 
representative, is entitled to a copy of the medical report, if requested. 

 

5.4 Claims for Property Damage 


 

5.4.1 Who is Covered? 


 

In a claim for damage to the automobile, the owner of the automobile is covered for damage. 

 

In a claim for damage to the contents of the automobile, the owner of the contents is covered for 
damage. 

 

5.4.2 Conditions Applying to Claims for Property Damage 


 

When making a claim for property damage, you and other insured persons must: 

 

. notify us in writing within seven days of the accident (or, if unable because of 
incapacity, as soon as possible after that), giving us the best information available at that 
time concerning the loss or damage and circumstances. 
. do as much as is reasonably possible to protect the automobile from further damage. We 
will pay for any reasonable protection provided. Further damage resulting from failure 
to provide reasonable protection will not be covered by this policy. 
. make no repairs beyond those needed for protection of the automobile, or remove 
evidence of the damage, without our written consent or until we have had time to inspect 
the automobile. 
. allow us to copy all documents in your or other insured persons' possession that relate to 
the accident. 
. permit us to inspect the automobile at any reasonable time. 
. complete a statutory declaration within 90 days of the accident, if requested. The 
declaration will describe what happened in detail, the cause and amount of the loss, those 
affected and how, and state that the loss was truly accidental. We will also need to know 
if any other insurance is involved. 
. not leave us to dispose of the automobile unless we agree to accept it. If we decide to 
replace the automobile or pay its actual cash value, less the deductible specified in your 
Certificate of Automobile Insurance, we own the salvage. 


 

 


5.4.3 Our Right to Repair, Replace or Rebuild the Automobile 


 

We have the right to repair, replace or rebuild the automobile rather than pay for the damage. If 
we choose to do this, we will let you or other insured persons know in writing within seven days 
of receiving notice of the claim. We will complete the work within a reasonable time using 
parts of similar kind and quality. 

 

5.4.4 How Much We Will Pay 


 

The most we will pay for the automobile is its actual cash value at the time it was damaged, less 
the deductible specified in your Certificate of Automobile Insurance. 

 

The value of the loss or damage is based on actual cash value after taking into account 
depreciation. We will not pay more to repair the automobile than its actual cash value at the time 
it was damaged, less the deductible specified in your Certificate of Automobile Insurance. 

 

We will pay the lower of the following: 

 

. the cost to repair the loss or damage, less the deductible; or 
. the actual cash value of the automobile at the time it was damaged, less the applicable 
deductible. 


 

Example 

 

Your car is four years old and is hit on the front left side by an identified but 
uninsured automobile. The damaged part of the body of your car is repaired. 
We will pay the cost of the repairs, less the $300 deductible, including new 
paint for the damaged part of your automobile. If you want the entire car 
repainted, you will have to pay the cost of painting the rest of the car. 



 

5.5 Claims for Both Bodily Injury and Property Damage 


 

An accident may result in a valid claim for both bodily injury or death and for damage to the 
automobile or its contents. In that case, payments for bodily injury and death have priority on 95% of 
the total amount payable. Payment for damage to the automobile or contents will have priority on 5%. 

 

Example 

 

An accident in Ontario for which an identified but uninsured driver is 
responsible destroys your $20,000 car, and results in injuries to you and your 
spouse, totalling $350,000. 

 

We will not pay more than the minimum liability limit of $200,000. Of that 
money, 95%, or $190,000, will go toward payment for bodily injury. The 




remaining 5%, or $10,000, will apply to the loss of your car. 



 

5.6 Settling a Claim 


 

5.6.1 By Agreement 


 

Questions about whether a claim is valid, and the amount of any payment, can be decided by 
agreement between us and you or other insured persons making the claim. 

 

5.6.2 By Arbitration 


 

If there is a disagreement, the matter may be settled by arbitration if you or other insured 
persons ask for it or if we ask for it and you agree. The arbitrator will be an individual 
acceptable to us and you or other insured persons. If both sides can't agree on an arbitrator, then 
each side will name an arbitrator. The two arbitrators will then appoint a third. A decision 
supported by at least two of the three will be binding. All arbitrations will be governed by the 
Arbitration Act, 1991 (Ontario). 

 

5.6.3 In Court 


 

The matter may be decided in a lawsuit brought against us by you or other insured persons in an 
Ontario court. If so, we have the right to ask the court to decide who is legally responsible and 
the amount of compensation owing, unless another Ontario court has already done so in an 
action that was defended. 

 

5.7 Limitations and Exceptions 


 

5.7.1 Payment Limits 


 

1. We will not pay more than the minimum limits for automobile liability insurance in 
the jurisdiction in which the accident happens. This amount applies regardless of the 
number of persons injured or killed, or the damage to the automobile and contents. 
In no event will we pay more than the minimum liability limits required in Ontario. 






 

Example 

 

You are travelling in a car outside Ontario when you are injured in an accident 
for which an uninsured driver is responsible. The minimum liability limit in that 
jurisdiction is $100,000. Your injuries are serious and are assessed at $300,000 
or more. We will pay no more than $100,000. 



 

 

 

 


 

 

 

2. We will not pay: 






 

. any amount, if you or other insured persons can make a valid claim under the 
liability section of a motor vehicle liability policy. 


 

. any amount for an accident in a jurisdiction where a valid claim can be made 
on an unsatisfied judgment fund or similar fund created for the purpose of 
compensating victims of uninsured or unidentified motorists. 


 

. for loss or damage caused by radioactive material. 
. for the first $300 worth of accidental damage to the automobile and its 
contents. 
. any amount over $25,000 in any one accident for damage to the automobile 
and its contents. 
. for loss or damage while a person specifically excluded from this policy is 
driving the automobile. 


 

5.7.2 Limit Where More Than One Policy Applies 


 

You or other insured persons may have a right to claim benefits from more than one automobile 
insurance policy covering accidents involving uninsured or unidentified automobiles. In that 
case, anyone making a claim under this or any other coverage may only recover once for the 
same loss. 

 

5.8 If You or Other Insured Persons Start a Lawsuit 


 

5.8.1 Send Us the Documents 






 

You or other insured persons or your representatives may decide to sue the owner, driver or 
operator of another automobile involved in the accident. In that case, a copy of the documents 
initiating the lawsuit must be provided to us as soon as the action is started. The documents must 
be delivered, or sent by registered mail, to our chief agent or head office in Ontario. 

 

5.8.2 If You or Other Insured Persons Win, But Can't Recover Payment 






 

If the court awards compensation but you or other insured persons can't recover from the person 
responsible, we will pay, if requested, either: 

 

. the full amount of the award; or 



. where some compensation has been paid, the difference between what you or other 
insured persons have been paid and the full amount awarded by the court. 


 

What we pay, of course, is subject to the limits and conditions applying to coverage for 
accidents involving uninsured or unidentified automobiles. 

 

5.8.3 Assignment of the Award 






 

We may require you or other insured persons, or your representatives, to assign to us the amount 
or balance of the court award before we make any payment. If we collect more than what we 
have already paid, we will reimburse the difference, minus our costs. 

 

5.9 Limitations on Legal Action 


 

5.9.1 Conditions of This Policy Must be Met 


 

No person has a right to sue us for compensation under this Section for injury or damage caused 
by an accident involving an uninsured or unidentified automobile, unless the conditions in this 
Section of your policy (Uninsured Automobile Coverage) have been met. 

 

5.9.2 Time Limits for Lawsuits for Loss or Damage 


 

Any lawsuit against us regarding loss or damage to the automobile or its contents must begin 
within a year after the loss or damage happens. 

 

Any lawsuit against us regarding loss or damage to property other than the automobile and its 
contents must begin within two years after the cause of action arose. 

 

5.9.3 Time Limits for Lawsuits for Bodily Injury or Death 


 

Any lawsuit against us regarding bodily injury or death must begin within two years after the 
cause of action arose. 

 


 

Section 6 



 

Direct Compensation - Property Damage Coverage 

 

 

You only have a particular coverage for a specific automobile if your 
Certificate of Automobile Insurance shows a premium for it or shows the 
coverage is provided at no cost. 



 

6.1 Introduction 


 

This Section of your policy covers damage to the automobile and certain trailers not shown on the 
Certificate of Automobile Insurance, their equipment, contents, and loss of use of the automobile or 
contents caused by another person's use or operation of an automobile in Ontario. 

 

The coverage under this Section applies only if the accident takes place in Ontario and at least one 
other automobile involved is insured under a motor vehicle liability policy. The policy covering the 
other automobile must be issued by an insurance company licensed in Ontario, or one that has filed 
with the Financial Services Commission of Ontario to provide this coverage. 

 

It is called direct compensation because you will collect from us, your insurance company, even 
though you, or anyone else using or operating the automobile with your consent, were not entirely at 
fault for the accident. 

 

6.2 What We Will Cover 


 

We will pay the cost of damage to the automobile, its equipment, contents and for loss of use of the 
automobile or contents arising from an accident for which another person would have been legally 
responsible in the absence of section 263 of the Insurance Act (Ontario). Section 263 takes away your 
right to sue the other person for these losses. We will pay no more to repair or replace the automobile 
or property than its actual cash value at the time it was damaged, less the applicable percentage of the 
deductible shown on your Certificate of Automobile Insurance. 

 

If a part needed to repair the automobile is no longer available, we will pay an amount equal to the 
manufacturer's latest list price for the part. 

 

Note: You should be aware that this coverage does not apply if the automobile is described in 
another motor vehicle liability policy. 


 

Example 


 


You are driving a friend's car. That car is described in your friend's motor 
vehicle liability policy. You have an accident for which you are not at fault. 


 


Your friend will claim under the direct compensation property damage 
provisions of his or her motor vehicle liability policy for the loss. 



 

We will not pay for damage to, or loss of use of, contents that are being carried for reward. 

 

6.3 Who is Covered 


 

In a claim for damage to the automobile, the owner of the automobile is covered for damage. 

 

In a claim for damage to the contents of the automobile, the owner of the contents is covered for 
damage. 

 

6.4 How Much We Will Pay 


 

6.4.1 Determining Fault 


 

The amount we pay under this Section of your policy will be determined by the degree to 
which you or the driver were not at fault in the accident. 

 

Responsibility for an accident is determined by the Insurance Act (Ontario) and the Fault 
Determination Rules. These may find you or the driver wholly or partially responsible. 

 

The degree of responsibility is expressed as a percentage. 

 

6.4.2 The Deductible 


 

The amount we pay may be subject to a Direct Compensation - Property Damage deductible. 
The deductible is the amount you agree to pay toward the cost of any single claim you make 
under this Section. The deductible, if any, is the amount shown on the Certificate of 
Automobile Insurance, multiplied by the percentage to which you or the driver of the 
automobile were not at fault for the accident. You are not permitted to sue anyone (for 
instance the at-fault motorist) to recover this deductible. 

 

If you have damage to both your automobile and its contents, the deductible will first be 
applied to your automobile loss. If there is any remaining deductible, the remainder will be 
applied to the contents loss. 

 

You will need to make a separate claim for each accident that causes damage. The deductible 
applies each time you make a claim and separately to each automobile that is insured. 


 

We will pay that portion of the total damages that is equal to the percentage to which you or 
the driver of the automobile were not at fault for the accident, less the applicable Direct 
Compensation-Property Damage deductible. 

 

Example #1 

(the other driver is entirely responsible) 

 

Your car has an actual cash value of $12,000. You are involved in an accident 
for which someone else is 100% responsible. Your car is a total loss. 

 

Your Direct Compensation - Property Damage (DC-PD) deductible is $500. 
We will pay $11,500 ($12,000 less $500, the deductible). We will also pay for 
reasonable alternate transportation. 

 

In sum: You receive $11,500. You are responsible for $500, the DC-PD 
deductible. 



 

Example #2 

(you are partly responsible - no optional Loss or Damage Coverages) 

 

Your car has an actual cash value of $12,000. You are involved in an accident 
and are 25% responsible. Your car is a total loss. 

 

Your Direct Compensation - Property Damage (DC-PD) deductible is $300. 
Under DC-PD, we cover the damages (less the deductible) for which the other 
driver would have otherwise been responsible. You are responsible for the 
deductible. We will pay $8,775 ($9,000 -- being 75% of the value of your 
automobile -- less $225 -- being 75% of the deductible). 

 

In sum: You receive $8,775. You are responsible for $225 (the DC-PD 
deductible), and will have to pay the remainder out of your own pocket. In this 
example, you will be out-of-pocket for a total of $3,225. (However, you may be 
entitled to recover part of that amount if you have bought additional optional 
Loss or Damage coverages under Section 7.) 



 


 

Example #3 

(damage to contents) 

 

Suppose you have just rented a floor sander currently worth $600 from the local 
Rent-All when you are involved in an accident. You are 25% responsible for 
the accident. The sander is destroyed. 

 

Your Direct Compensation  Property Damage (DC-PD) deductible is $500. 
We will pay $75 ($450  being 75% of the value of the sander  less $375  
being 75% of the deductible.) 

 

In sum: You will receive $75. You are responsible for $375 (the DC-PD 
deductible), and that portion of the damage for which you are responsible. 



 

Example #4 

(damage to automobile and contents) 

 

You are involved in an accident for which you are not responsible. The repair of 
your car costs $250. Contents worth $125 are destroyed. 

 

Your Direct Compensation - Property Damage (DC-PD) deductible is $300. We 
will pay $0 ($250 less $250) toward your car damage, and $75 ($125 less $50) 
for the contents to the owner of the contents. 

 

In sum: The owner of the contents receives $75. You are responsible for $300, 
the DC-PD deductible. 



 

6.5 Your and Other Insured Persons' Responsibilities 


 

When making a claim for property damage, you and other insured persons must: 

 

. notify us in writing within seven days of any accident (or, if unable, because of incapacity, as 
soon as possible after that), giving us the best information available at that time concerning the 
loss or damage and circumstances. 
. do as much as is reasonably possible to protect the automobile from further damage. We will 
pay for any reasonable protection provided. Further damage resulting from failure to provide 
reasonable protection will not be covered by this policy. 
. make no repairs beyond those needed for protection of the automobile, or remove evidence of 
the damage, without our written consent or until we have had time to inspect the automobile. 
. allow us to copy all documents in your or other insured persons' possession that relate to the 
accident. 



. permit us to inspect the automobile at any reasonable time. 
. complete a statutory declaration within 90 days of the accident, if requested. The declaration 
will describe what happened in detail, the cause and amount of the loss, those affected and 
how, and state that the loss was truly accidental. We will also need to know if any other 
insurance is involved. 
. not leave us to dispose of the automobile unless we agree to accept it. If we decide to replace 
the automobile or pay its actual cash value, less the applicable deductible, we own the salvage. 


 

6.6 Our Right to Repair, Replace or Rebuild the Automobile 


 

We have the right to repair, replace or rebuild the automobile rather than pay for the damage. If we 
choose to do this, we will let you or other insured persons know in writing within seven days of 
receiving notice of the claim. We will complete the work within a reasonable time using parts of 
similar kind and quality. 

 

6.7 Other Limitations on Your Coverage 


 

6.7.1 Contamination of Property 


 

Under this Section, we won't cover claims arising from contamination of property carried in 
the automobile. 

 

6.7.2 Nuclear Hazards 


 

Nuclear energy hazards means radioactive, toxic, explosive or other hazardous properties of 
substances described in Regulations made under the Nuclear Safety and Control Act (Canada). 

 

If you or other insured persons are involved in an accident where the loss or damage is directly 
or indirectly caused by a nuclear hazard, we will pay up to $200,000 if you or other insured 
persons are covered under this policy for a nuclear hazard and you or other insured persons are 
also insured under a nuclear energy hazard liability policy. We will only pay after the limits of 
that policy have been paid out. 

 

6.7.3 Settling a Claim 


 

If you disagree with the degree of fault attributed to you under the Fault Determination Rules 
or with the amount of any proposed settlement, you can bring a law suit against us to have the 
matter determined by a judge. 

 

Alternatively, if the disagreement is over the value of the vehicle or its contents or the nature, 
amount or cost of any repairs or the amount we should pay, the matter can be settled by an 
appraisal under the Insurance Act, if you ask for it or if we ask for it and you agree. You and 
we will each appoint an appraiser, who will either agree on the award or, if they disagree, will 
appoint an umpire to decide as between their respective positions. 


 

Section 7 



 

Loss or Damage Coverages 

(Optional) 

 

You only have a particular coverage for a specific automobile if your Certificate 
of Automobile Insurance shows a premium for it or shows the coverage is 
provided at no cost. 



 

7.1 Introduction 


 

7.1.1 Coverage for Loss of or Damage to Your Automobile 


 

We agree to pay for direct and accidental loss of, or damage to, a described automobile and its 
equipment caused by a peril such as fire, theft, or collision if the automobile is insured against 
these perils. 

 

By direct loss or damage we mean loss or damage resulting directly from a peril for which 
coverage has been purchased. 

 

This Section applies only to the extent that a claim for damage to an automobile and its 
equipment would not be covered by Section 6, Direct Compensation - Property Damage 
Coverage of a motor vehicle liability policy. 

 

We may inspect the described vehicle and its equipment at any reasonable time. If you do not 
co-operate with any reasonable arrangements for inspection, your coverages under this Section 
may be cancelled and any claims under this Section may be denied. 

 

Your Loss or Damage Coverages may apply to types of automobiles other than 
described automobiles. See Section 2 for details and additional conditions. 



 

7.1.2 Coverage Options 


 

You may choose from among the four types of protection listed below. Your choice will be 
shown on the Certificate of Automobile Insurance. 

 

Note: All of the following coverages are subject to 7.2. 


 

A. Specified Perils - we will only pay for losses caused by fire; theft or attempted theft; 
lightning, windstorm, hail, or rising water; earthquake; explosion; riot or civil 
disturbance; falling or forced landing of aircraft or parts of aircraft; or the stranding, 
sinking, burning, derailment or collision of any kind of transport in, or upon which a 
described automobile is being carried on land or water. 
B. Comprehensive - we will pay for losses, other than those covered by Collision or Upset, 
including: 
. perils listed under Specified Perils, 
. falling or flying objects, 
. missiles, and 
. vandalism. 


 

C. Collision or Upset - we will pay for losses caused when a described automobile is 
involved in a collision with another object or tips over. Object includes: 
. another automobile that is attached to the automobile, 
. the surface of the ground, and 
. any object in or on the ground. 


 

D. All Perils -this option combines the coverages of Collision or Upset and Comprehensive. 
This coverage includes loss or damage caused if a person who lives in your household 
steals a described automobile. Coverage also applies if an employee who drives or uses, 
services or repairs a described automobile, steals it. 


 

7.2 Loss or Damage We Won't Cover 


 

7.2.1 General 


 

We will not cover the following losses unless they result from a peril for which you are 
covered or they are caused by fire, theft or vandalism and your policy covers these perils: 

 

. to tires; 
. consisting of, or caused by mechanical fracture or breakdown of any part of the 
automobile; or 
. consisting of, or caused by rusting, corrosion, wear and tear, freezing, or explosion 
within the engine. 


 

 

 

 

 


Example 

 

We will not pay for a tire blow-out in normal driving, but if the tire is destroyed 
in a collision and you have Collision or Upset Coverage, we will cover that loss 
up to the value of your tire at the time of the incident. 



 

We won't pay for loss or damage: 

 

. resulting from a dishonest claim of ownership, illegal disposal, or theft of the 
automobile by anyone who has legal possession of it under a written agreement (a 
mortgage, conditional sale, lease or other similar agreement); 
. resulting from a change in ownership that is agreed to, even if that change was brought 
about by trickery or fraud; 


 

Example 

 

Late one evening at a party, you sell your car to a stranger in return for a 
cheque. A week later the cheque bounces. We will not cover the loss. 



 

. caused by radioactive contamination; 
. to contents of automobiles and trailers, other than their equipment; and 
. in excess of $25 for recorded material and equipment for use with a playing or 
recording unit. We will not pay for recorded material and equipment not contained 
within or attached to the playing or recording unit. Recorded material includes, but is 
not limited to, tapes, compact discs, video cassettes and digital video discs. 


 

7.2.2 Illegal Use 


 

We won't pay for loss or damage caused in an incident: 

 

. if you are unable to maintain proper control of the automobile because you are driving 
or operating the automobile while under the influence of intoxicating substances; 
. if you are convicted of one of the following offences under the Criminal Code of 
Canada relating to the operation, care or control of the automobile, or committed by 
means of an automobile, or any similar offence under any law in Canada or the United 
States: 
o causing bodily harm by criminal negligence 
o dangerous operation of motor vehicles 
o failure to stop at the scene of an accident 





o operation of motor vehicle when impaired or with more than 80 mg of alcohol 
in the blood 
o refusal to comply with demand for breath sample 
o causing bodily harm during operation of vehicle while impaired or over 80 mg 
of alcohol in the blood, or 
o operating a motor vehicle while disqualified from doing so; 


. if you use or permit the automobile to be used in a race or speed test, or for illegal 
activity; 
. if you drive the automobile while not authorized by law; and 
. if another person, with your permission, drives or operates the automobile under any of 
these conditions. 


 

7.2.3 Certain Thefts Not Covered 


 

We won't pay under either the Comprehensive or Specified Perils coverages for loss or 
damage caused when a person who lives in your household steals the automobile. 

 

We also won't pay under these coverages for loss or damage caused when an employee of 
yours steals the automobile and the employee's duties include driving, maintaining or repairing 
the automobile. This applies at any time, and not simply during working hours. 

 

7.3 The Deductible 


 

The amount we pay to cover any losses may be subject to a deductible. The deductible is the amount 
you agree to pay toward the cost of any single claim you make under this Section. The deductible, if 
any, is shown on the Certificate of Automobile Insurance. 

 

You will need to make a separate claim for each incident that causes loss or damage. The deductible 
applies each time you make a claim and separately to each automobile that is insured. 

 

We will only pay for loss or damage that exceeds the amount of the deductible. If your claim is one to 
which Section 6, Direct Compensation - Property Damage (DC-PD) Coverage also applies, the 
amount we will pay under this Section will not include the DC-PD deductible that applies to the 
claim. Your deductible under this Section will be the Collision deductible multiplied by the 
percentage to which you or the driver of the automobile were at fault for the accident. 

 

Example #1 

 

You have Comprehensive Coverage, and your deductible is $500. Your car's 
windshield is broken by a fallen tree. You are responsible for the first $500 of 
the cost of the windshield replacement. Any claim less than $500 will be your 
responsibility. 



 


 

Example #2 

(you are fully responsible - with optional Loss or Damage Coverages) 

 

Your car has an actual cash value of $12,000. You are involved in an accident 
and are 100% responsible. Your car is a total loss. 

 

You receive nothing under your Direct Compensation - Property Damage 
Coverage. 

 

You have the optional Collision or Upset Coverage and your deductible is $500. 
Under the optional coverage, we will pay $11,500 ($12,000 less $500, the 
deductible). 

 

In sum: You receive $11,500. You are responsible for $500, the Collision 
deductible. 



 

 

Example #3 

(you are partly responsible - with optional Loss or Damage Coverages) 

 

Your car has an actual cash value of $12,000. You are involved in an accident 
and are 25% responsible. Your car is a total loss. 

 

Your Direct Compensation - Property Damage (DC-PD) deductible is $300. 
Under DC-PD, we will pay $8,775 ($9,000 -- being 75% of the value of your 
automobile -- less $225 -- being 75% of the deductible). 

 

You have the optional Collision or Upset Coverage and your deductible is $500. 
Under the optional coverage, we will pay a further $2,875 ($3,000 --being 25% 
of the value of your auto --less $125 -- being 25% of the deductible). 

 

In sum: You receive $11,650. You are responsible for the deductibles totalling 
$350. 



 


 

Example #4 

(you are partly responsible - with optional Loss or Damage Coverages) 

 

You are involved in an accident for which you are 25% responsible. Your car 
sustains $5,000 in damage. 

 

Your Direct Compensation - Property Damage (DC-PD) deductible is $300. 
Under DC-PD, we will pay $3,525 ($3,750 -- being 75% of $5,000 --less $225 
-- being 75% of the DC-PD deductible). 

 

You have the optional Collision or Upset Coverage and your deductible is $500. 
Under the optional coverage, we will pay a further $1,125 ($1,250 --being 25% 
of $5,000 --less $125 -- being 25% of the deductible). 

 

In sum: You receive $4,650. You are responsible for the deductibles totalling 
$350. 



 

If you are insured for loss or damage caused by fire or lightning, there is no deductible for these 
losses. 

 

7.4 Additional Benefits 


 

Whatever Loss or Damage Coverage you choose under this Section, your coverage will include the 
following additional benefits. 

 

7.4.1 Payment of Charges 


 

We will pay general average, salvage and fire department charges and any Canadian or U.S. 
customs duties for which you are legally responsible as a result of an insured peril. 

 

Example 

 

Your car is damaged in a fire. The fire department properly bills you for the 
cost of putting out the fire. A new transmission must be imported before the car 
can be repaired. We will pay the fire department's bill, import duties on the 
replacement part and for the parts and repairs themselves. 



 

In this instance, salvage means any expense involved in recovering property to prevent loss 
from an insured peril. 

 

General average charges may arise when a described automobile is shipped by water. If it 
becomes necessary to dump a portion of the ship's cargo overboard to save the ship, you may 
be legally responsible for a share of the resulting losses. We will cover that expense. 


 

7.4.2 Foregoing Our Right to Recover 


 

If someone else is using a described automobile with your permission when an insured loss 
occurs, we will pay for the resulting claim. We will also forego our right to recover the money 
from that person. 

 

However, we will keep the right to recover payment: 

 

. if the person has the automobile in connection with the business of selling, repairing, 
maintaining, storing, servicing or parking automobiles; or 
. if the person using the automobile violates any condition of this policy, or operates it in 
circumstances referred to in 7.2.2. 


 

Examples 

 

1. You allow a friend to use your car and she runs into a fire hydrant and 
damages the car. We will pay for repairs and will not sue her to recover 
the money. 


 

2. You hand over your car to a parking attendant or garage employee. He 
scratches the side while parking it. We will pay for repairs and recover 
from the garage owners because they had your automobile in connection 
with their business. 


 

3. You allow a friend to use your car. Later, without your knowledge, he 
drives it while impaired by alcohol and hits a tree. We will pay for the 
repairs to the car, but we will recover from your friend. Driving while 
impaired is illegal and a violation of the terms of this policy. 




 

7.4.3 Temporary Substitute Automobile Covered 


 

If you or anyone else drives a temporary substitute automobile (described in Section 2), you 
may be responsible for any damage to it as a result of liability imposed by law or agreed to by 
you or the driver. In that case, we will pay for direct damage for which you or the driver are 
legally responsible, minus the deductible for that peril under this policy. 

 

However, if the owner of the substitute automobile has it insured for such losses, and the 
deductible on that policy is larger than the one on your own policy for such loss, the most we 
will pay will be the difference between the two deductibles. 

 

If there is a disagreement over who is responsible for the damage, we have the right just as we 
would under Section 3 - Liability Coverage, to settle the matter appropriately and we will 
cover the costs of any investigation, negotiation or lawsuit. 


 

 

Example #1 

You rent a car to replace your own, which is being repaired following an 
accident. While driving the rental car, you cause $800 worth of damage to it. 
The rental company has a collision policy with a $1,000 deductible. The 
Collision deductible in your policy is only $500. In settling the matter, we will 
pay $300 ($800 less $500). 



 

Example #2 

 

You rent a car to replace your own, which is being repaired following an 
accident. While driving the rental car, you cause $2,800 worth of damage to it. 
The rental company has a collision policy with a $1,000 deductible. The 
Collision deductible in your policy is only $500. In settling the matter, we will 
pay $500, the difference between the deductibles. 



 

7.4.4 Loss of Use Due to Theft 


 

If a described automobile is stolen, and you are protected by the All Perils, Comprehensive, or 
Specified Perils options, we will pay reasonable expenses for the rental of a similar substitute 
automobile. 

 

If you choose not to rent an automobile, we will pay reasonable expenses incurred for taxis or 
public transportation. 

 

We wont cover these costs until 72 hours after the theft has been reported to us or to the 
police. Even if your policy expires after the theft, coverage will continue until your automobile 
is repaired or replaced, or sooner if money is offered to settle the claim. 

 

The most we will pay in either case for such expenses is $900. 

 

 

7.5 Your and Other Insured Persons' Responsibilities 


 

When making a claim under this Section, you and other insured persons must: 

 

. notify us in writing within seven days of the incident (or, if unable because of 
incapacity, as soon as possible after that), giving us the best information available at 
that time concerning the loss or damage and circumstances. 
. do as much as is reasonably possible to protect the automobile from further damage. 
We will pay for any reasonable protection provided. Further damage resulting from 
failure to provide reasonable protection will not be covered by this policy. 



. make no repairs beyond those needed for protection of the automobile, or remove 
evidence of the damage, without our written consent or until we have had time to 
inspect the automobile. 
. allow us to copy all documents in your or other insured persons' possession that relate 
to the incident. 
. permit us to inspect the automobile at any reasonable time. 
. complete a statutory declaration within 90 days of the incident, if requested. The 
declaration will describe what happened in detail, the cause and amount of the loss, 
those affected and how, and state that the loss was truly accidental. We will also need 
to know if any other insurance is involved. 
. not leave us to dispose of the automobile unless we agree to accept it. If we decide to 
replace the automobile or pay its actual cash value, less the deductible shown in your 
Certificate of Automobile Insurance, we own the salvage. 


 

7.6 Our Right to Repair, Replace or Rebuild the Automobile 


 

We have the right to repair, replace or rebuild the automobile rather than pay for the damage. If we 
choose to do this, we will let you or other insured persons know in writing within seven days of 
receiving notice of the claim. We will complete the work within a reasonable time using parts of 
similar kind and quality. 

 

7.7 What We Will Pay 


 

We will not pay more for the automobile than its actual cash value at the time it was damaged or 
stolen, less the deductible shown in your Certificate of Automobile Insurance. 

 

The value of the loss or damage is also based on actual cash value after taking into account 
depreciation. We will not pay more to repair the automobile than its actual cash value at the time it 
was damaged or stolen, less the deductible. 

 

We will pay the lower of the following: 

 

. the cost to repair the loss or damage, less the deductible; or 
. the actual cash value of the automobile at the time it was damaged or stolen, less the 
deductible. 


 

Example 

 

When your automobile was new, three years ago, it cost $16,000. Today, its 
actual cash value is $10,000. You have the optional Comprehensive Coverage 
and your deductible is $500. If the automobile were totally destroyed in a fire or 




by lightning, the most we would pay under the optional coverage is $10,000. If 
the automobile were stolen, the most we would pay under the optional coverage 
is $9,500 ($10,000 - $500). 



 

We will not pay more than $1,500 for loss or damage to electronic accessories or equipment other 
than factory installed equipment. We will pay the actual cash value of the equipment up to $1,500 in 
total. 

 

Electronic accessories and equipment includes, but is not limited to, radios, tape players/decks, 
stereo players/decks, compact disc players, speakers, telephones, two-way radios including CB radios, 
ham radios and VHF radios, televisions, facsimile machines, electronic navigation assistance, 
positioning and location finding devices, computers, and items of a similar nature. 

 

Factory installed equipment means electronic accessories and equipment which was included in the 
original new purchase price of the automobile. 

 

7.8 Settling a Claim 


 

If you disagree with us over the value of the vehicle or equipment or the nature or the amount or costs 
of any repairs or the amount we should pay, the issue can be submitted for an appraisal under the 
Insurance Act, if you ask for it, or if we ask for it and you agree. You and we will each appoint an 
appraiser, who will either agree on the award or, if they disagree, will appoint an umpire to decide as 
between their respective positions.

The insured shall permit the insurer at all reasonable times to inspect the automobile and its 
equipment.

disagreement, if an appraisal referred to in subcondition (2.1) is carried out in respect of

(1.1) If the insurer gives a notice of termination under sub condition (1) for areas on other than 
non-payment of the whole or any part of the premium due under the contract or of any 
charge under any agreement ancillary to the contract or if the insurer gives a notice of 
termination in accordance with sub condition (1.7), the notice of termination shall terminate 
the contract no earlier than.

registered mail; or 
(b) the fifth day after the insurer gives the notice, if the insurer gives the notice by personal 
delivery. 


 

(1.2) Subject to sub condition (1.7), if the insurer gives a notice of termination under sub condition 
(1) for the reason of non-payment of the whole or any part of the premium due under the 
contract or of any charge under any agreement ancillary to the contract, the notice of 
termination shall comply with sub condition(1.3) and shall specify a day for the termination 
of the contract that is no earlier than, 


 

(a) the 30th day after the insurer gives the notice, if the insurer gives the notice by 
registered mail; or 
(b) the 10th day after the insurer gives the notice, if the insurer gives the notice by personal 
delivery. 


 

(1.3) A notice of termination mentioned in sub condition (1.2) shall, 


 

(a) state the amount due under the contract as at the date of the notice; and 
(b) state that the contract will terminate at 12:01 a.m. of the day specified for termination 
unless the full amount mentioned in clause (a), together with an administration fee not 
exceeding the amount approved under Part XV of the Act, payable in cash or by money 
order or certified cheque payable to the order of the insurer or as the notice otherwise 
directs, is delivered to the address in Ontario that the notice specifies, not later than 
12:00 noon on the business day before the day specified for termination. 


 

 




(1.4) For the purposes of clause (a) of sub condition (1.3), if the insured and the insurer have

premium under the contract in instalments, the amount due under the contract as at the date 
of the notice shall not exceed the amount of the instalments due but unpaid as at the date of 
the notice. 


 

(1.5) If the full amount payable under clause (b) of sub condition (1.3) is not paid by the time and 
in the manner that the notice specifies, the contract shall be deemed to be terminated, without 
any further action being required on the part of the insurer, as of 12:01 a.m. of the day 
specified for termination. 


 

(1.6) If the full amount payable under clause (b) of sub condition (1.3) is paid by the time and in 
the manner that the notice specifies, the contract shall not terminate on the day specified for 
termination and the notice shall have no further force or effect. 


 

(1.7) If, on two previous occasions in respect of the contract, the insurer has given a notice of 
termination mentioned in sub condition (1.2) and the full amount payable under clause (b) of 
sub condition (1.3) has been paid by the time and in the manner that the notice specifies and 
if a non-payment again occurs of the whole or any part of the premium due under the 
contract or of any charge under any agreement ancillary to the contract, the insurer may, by 
registered mail or personal delivery, give to the insured a notice of termination of the 
contract and sub condition (1.1) applies to the notice, instead of sub condition (1.2). 


 

(2) This contract may be terminated by the insured at any time on request. 


 

(3) Where this contract is terminated by the insurer, 


 

(a) the insurer shall refund the excess of premium actually paid by the insured over the 
proportionate premium for the expired time, but in no event shall the proportionate 
premium for the expired time be deemed to be less than any minimum retained premium 
specified; 
(b) if the termination is for a reason other than non-payment of the whole or any part of the 
premium due under the contract or of any charge under any agreement ancillary to the 
contract or if the insurer gives a notice of termination in accordance with sub condition 
(1.7), the refund shall accompany the notice, unless the premium is subject to adjustment 
or determination as to the amount, in which case, the refund shall be made as soon as 
practicable; and 
(c) if the termination is for the reason of non-payment of the whole or any part of the 
premium due under the contract or of any charge under any agreement ancillary to the 
contract and if sub condition (1.7) does not apply to the termination, the refund shall be 
made as soon as practicable after the effective date of the termination. 


 

 

 




(4) Where this contract is terminated by the insured, the insurer shall refund as soon as practicable 
the excess of premium actually paid by the insured over the short rate premium for the expired 
time, but in no event shall the short rate premium for the expired time be deemed to be less 
than any minimum retained premium specified.

The premium for each auto is based on information 
Allstate has received from you or other sources. 
You agree to cooperate with us in determining if this 
information is correct, if it is complete, and if it 
changes during the policy period. You agree that if 
this information changes or is incorrect or 
incomplete, we may adjust your premium 
accordingly during the policy period. 
Changes which result in a premium adjustment are 
contained in our rules. These include, but are not 
limited to: 
1. autos insured by the policy, including changes 
in use. 
2. drivers residing in your household, their ages or 
marital status. 
3. coverages or coverage limits. 
4. rating territory. 
5. discount eligibility. 
Any calculation or adjustment of your premium will 
be made using the rules, rates and forms in effect, 
and on file if required, for our use in your state. 
Coverage Changes 
When Allstate broadens a coverage during the policy 
period without additional charge, you have the new 
feature if you have the coverage to which it applies. 
The new feature applies on the date the coverage 
change is effective in your state. Otherwise, the 
policy can be changed only by endorsement. Any 
change in your coverage will be made using the 
rules, rates and forms in effect, and on file if required, 
for our use in your state. 
Duty To Report Autos 
You must tell us within 60 days when you acquire an 
additional or replacement auto. If you dont, certain 
coverages of this policy may not apply. 
COMBINING LIMITS OF TWO OR MORE 
AUTOS PROHIBITED 
IF YOU HAVE TWO OR MORE AUTOS INSURED IN 
YOUR NAME AND ONE OF THESE AUTOS IS 
INVOLVED IN AN ACCIDENT, ONLY THE COVERAGE 
LIMITS SHOWN ON THE POLICY DECLARATIONS 
FOR THAT AUTO WILL APPLY. WHEN YOU HAVE 
TWO OR MORE AUTOS INSURED IN YOUR NAME 
AND NONE OF THEM IS INVOLVED IN THE 
ACCIDENT, YOU MAY CHOOSE ANY SINGLE AUTO 
SHOWN ON THE POLICY DECLARATIONS AND THE 
COVERAGE LIMITS APPLICABLE TO THAT AUTO 
WILL APPLY. 
THE LIMITS AVAILABLE FOR ANY OTHER AUTO 
COVERED BY THE POLICY WILL NOT BE ADDED TO 
THE COVERAGE FOR THE INVOLVED OR CHOSEN

Automobile Liability Insurance 
Bodily Injury __ Coverage AA 
Property Damage __ Coverage 
BB 
Allstate will pay for damages an insured person is 
legally obligated to pay because of: 
1. bodily injury sustained by any person, and 
2. damage to, or destruction of, property. 
Under these coverages, your policy protects an 
insured person from liability for damages arising out 
of the ownership, maintenance or use, loading or 
unloading of an insured auto. 
We will defend an insured person sued for damages 
which are covered by this policy, even if the suit is 
groundless or false. We will choose the counsel. 
We may settle any claim or suit if we believe it is 
proper. We will not defend an insured person sued 
for damages which are not covered by this policy. 
Additional Payments Allstate Will Make 
When we defend an insured person under this part, 
we will pay 
1. up to $50 a day for loss of wages or salary if we 
ask that person to attend hearings or trials to 
defend against a bodily injury suit. We wont 
pay for loss of other income. We will pay other 
reasonable expenses incurred at our request. 
2. court costs for defense. 
3. interest accruing on damages awarded. We will 
pay this interest only until we have paid, offered, 
or deposited in court the amount for which we 
are liable under this policy. We will only pay 
interest on damages not exceeding our limits of 
liability. 
4. premiums on appeal bonds and on bonds to 
release attachments, but not in excess of our 
limit of liability. We arent required to apply for 
or furnish these bonds. 
We will repay an insured person for 
1. the cost of any bail bonds required due to an 
accident or traffic law violation involving the use 
of the insured auto. We wont pay more than 
$300 per bond. We arent required to apply for 
or furnish these bonds.

LIMITS OF LIABILITY 
THE LIMITS SHOWN ON THE POLICY

INCLUDING DAMAGES SUSTAINED BY ANYONE 
ELSE AS A RESULT OF THAT BODILY INJURY. 
SUBJECT TO THE LIMIT FOR EACH PERSON, THE 
LIMIT STATED FOR EACH OCCURRENCE IS OUR 
TOTAL LIMIT OF LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES FOR 
BODILY INJURY SUSTAINED BY TWO OR MORE 
PERSONS IN ANY SINGLE AUTO ACCIDENT. FOR 
PROPERTY DAMAGE, THE LIMIT APPLIES TO 
DAMAGES ARISING FROM EACH OCCURRENCE. 
THE LIABILITY LIMITS APPLY TO EACH INSURED 
AUTO AS SHOWN ON THE POLICY DECLARATIONS. 
THE INSURING OF MORE THAN ONE PERSON OR 
AUTO UNDER THIS POLICY WILL NOT INCREASE 
OUR LIABILITY LIMITS BEYOND THE AMOUNT 
SHOWN FOR ANY ONE AUTO, EVEN THOUGH A 
SEPARATE PREMIUM IS CHARGED FOR EACH 
AUTO. THE LIMITS ALSO WONT BE INCREASED IF 
YOU HAVE OTHER AUTO INSURANCE POLICIES 
THAT APPLY.

MADE UNDER THE BODILY INJURY LIABILITY 
COVERAGE, UNINSURED MOTORISTS COVERAGE 
AND MEDICAL PAYMENTS COVERAGE OF THIS 
POLICY.

PERSON AS THE RESULT OF ANY ONE AUTO 
ACCIDENT. 
THE MEDICAL PAYMENTS LIMIT APPLIES TO EACH

NOT INCREASE OUR LIMIT BEYOND THE AMOUNT 
SHOWN FOR ANY ONE AUTO, EVEN THOUGH A

MADE UNDER THE BODILY INJURY LIABILITY AND 
AUTOMOBILE MEDICAL PAYMENTS COVERAGES

BEHALF OF ANY PERSON UNDER THIS COVERAGE 
WILL BE CONSIDERED AS ADVANCE PAYMENTS TO

POLICY WILL BE REDUCED BY THAT AMOUNT. 
Unreasonable Or Unnecessary Medical 
Expenses 
If the insured person incurs medical expenses which 
are unreasonable or unnecessary, we may refuse to 
pay for those expenses and contest them. 
Unreasonable medical expenses are fees for medical 
services which are substantially higher than the usual 
and customary charges for those services. 
Unnecessary medical expenses are fees for medical 
services which are not usually and customarily 
performed for treatment of the injury, including fees 
for an excessive number, amount, or duration of 
medical services. 
If the insured person is sued by a medical services 
provider because we refuse to pay contested medical 
expenses, we will pay all defense costs and any 
resulting judgment against the insured person. We 
will choose the counsel. The insured person must 
cooperate with us in the defense of any claim or 
lawsuit. If we ask the insured person to attend 
hearings or trials, we will pay up to $50 per day for 
loss of wages or salary. We will also pay other 
reasonable expenses incurred at our request. 
IF THERE IS OTHER INSURANCE

we reasonably require. We must be given 
authorization to obtain medical reports and other 
records pertinent to the claim.

Part 5 
Uninsured Motorists Insurance 
Coverage SS 
We will pay damages because of bodily injury which 
an insured person is legally entitled to recover from 
the owner or operator of an uninsured auto. Bodily 
injury must be caused by accident and arise out of 
the ownership, maintenance or use of an uninsured 
auto. We will not pay any punitive or exemplary 
damages. 
The right to benefits and the amount payable will be 
decided by agreement between the insured person 
and Allstate. If an agreement cant be reached, the 
decision may be made by arbitration. 
If an insured person sues a person believed 
responsible for the accident without giving us notice 
so as to give us adequate time to intervene in a 
lawsuit, we arent bound by any resulting judgment. 
Insured Persons 
1. You and any relative who resides in your 
household. 
2. Any other person while in, on, getting into or out 
of your insured auto with your permission. 
3. Any other person who is legally entitled to 
recover because of bodily injury to you, a 
relative who resides in your household, or an 
occupant of your insured auto with your 
permission. 
An insured auto is a motor vehicle: 
1. described on the Policy Declarations and the 
motor vehicle you replace it with. 
2. you acquire ownership of during the policy 
period. This additional motor vehicle will be 
covered if Allstate insures all other private 
passenger motor vehicles you own. You must, 
however, notify Allstate within 60 days after you 
acquire the motor vehicle and you must pay any 
additional premium. 
3. not owned by you or a relative who resides in 
your household, being temporarily used while 
your insured auto is being serviced or repaired, 
or if your insured auto is stolen or destroyed. 
The motor vehicle must be used with the 
owners permission. It cant be furnished for the 
regular use of you or any relative who resides in 
your household. 
4. not owned by you or a relative who resides in 
your household, being operated by you with the 
owners permission. The motor vehicle cant be 
furnished for the regular use of you or any 
relative who resides in your household.

person.

examinations by physicians selected by us, as often 
as we reasonably require. The insured person or that 
persons representative must authorize us to obtain

If We Cannot Agree 
If the insured person and we dont agree on that 
persons right to receive damages on any claim 
involving an amount of $3000 or less, the dispute will 
be settled by arbitration. 
If the insured person and we dont agree on that 
persons right to receive damages on any claim 
involving an amount over $3000, then upon the 
mutual consent of the insured person and Allstate 
the disagreement may be settled by arbitration. The 
insured person and we, however, must mutually 
agree to arbitrate the disagreements. If the insured 
person and we do not agree to arbitrate, then the 
disagreement will be resolved in a court of competent 
jurisdiction. 
Unless the insured person or we object, arbitration 
will take place under the rules of the American 
Arbitration Association. 
If either party objects to the use of the rules of the 
American Arbitration Association, the following 
alternative method of arbitration will be used. The 
insured person will select one arbitrator and we will 
select another. The two arbitrators will select a third. 
If they cant agree on a third arbitrator within 30 days, 
the judge of the court of record in the county of 
jurisdiction where arbitration is pending will appoint 
the third arbitrator. The written decision of any two 
arbitrators will determine the issues. Local rules 
governing evidence and procedure will apply. The 
insured person will pay the arbitrator that person 
selects and we will pay the one we select. The 
expense of the third arbitrator and all other expenses 
of arbitration will be shared equally. However, 
attorney fees and fees paid to medical or other expert 
witnesses are not considered arbitration expenses 
and are to be paid by the party incurring them. 
Regardless of the method of arbitration, either party 
has a right to a trial on all issues in a court of 
competent jurisdiction. Costs, including attorney 
fees, are to be paid by the party incurring them.

LIMITS OF LIABILITY 
ALLSTATES LIMIT OF LIABILITY IS THE ACTUAL 
CASH VALUE OF THE PROPERTY OR DAMAGED 
PART OF THE PROPERTY AT THE TIME OF LOSS. 
THE ACTUAL CASH VALUE WILL BE REDUCED BY 
THE DEDUCTIBLE FOR EACH COVERAGE AS 
SHOWN ON THE POLICY DECLARATIONS. 
HOWEVER, OUR LIABILITY WILL NOT EXCEED 
WHAT IT WOULD COST TO REPAIR OR REPLACE 
THE PROPERTY OR PART WITH OTHER OF LIKE 
KIND AND QUALITY. THE LIMIT FOR LOSS TO ANY 
COVERED TRAILER NOT DESCRIBED ON THE 
POLICY DECLARATIONS IS $500. 
AN AUTO AND ATTACHED TRAILER ARE 
CONSIDERED SEPARATE AUTOS, AND YOU MUST 
PAY THE DEDUCTIBLE, IF ANY, ON EACH. ONLY 
ONE DEDUCTIBLE WILL APPLY TO AN AUTO WITH 
A MOUNTED CAMPER UNIT. IF UNMOUNTED, A 
SEPARATE DEDUCTIBLE WILL APPLY TO THE AUTO 
AND CAMPER UNIT. 
IF THERE IS OTHER INSURANCE 
IF THERE IS OTHER INSURANCE COVERING THE 
LOSS AT THE TIME OF THE ACCIDENT, WE WILL 
PAY ONLY OUR SHARE OF ANY DAMAGES. OUR 
SHARE IS DETERMINED BY ADDING THE LIMITS OF 
THIS INSURANCE TO THE LIMITS OF ALL OTHER 
INSURANCE THAT APPLIES ON THE SAME BASIS 
AND FINDING THE PERCENTAGE OF THE TOTAL 
THAT OUR LIMITS REPRESENT. 
WHEN THIS INSURANCE COVERS A SUBSTITUTE 
AUTO OR NON-OWNED AUTO, WE WILL PAY ONLY 
AFTER ALL OTHER COLLECTIBLE INSURANCE HAS 
BEEN EXHAUSTED. 
WHEN THIS INSURANCE COVERS A REPLACEMENT 
AUTO OR ADDITIONAL AUTO, THIS POLICY WONT 
APPLY IF YOU HAVE OTHER COLLECTIBLE 
INSURANCE. 
WHEN MORE THAN ONE COVERAGE IS APPLICABLE 
TO THE LOSS, YOU MAY RECOVER UNDER THE 
BROADEST COVERAGE BUT NOT BOTH. HOWEVER, 
ANY COVERAGE ZA DEDUCTIBLE WILL ALWAYS 
APPLY. 
Action Against Allstate 
No one may sue us under this coverage unless there 
is full compliance with all the policy terms. 
Subrogation Rights 
When we pay, your rights of recovery from anyone 
else become ours up to the amount we have paid. 
You must protect these rights and help us enforce 
them. 
What You Must Do If There Is A Loss 
1. As soon as possible, any person making claim 
must give us written proof of loss. It must

earned during that period had the Incident not occurred. 

Where under the terms of the lease or leases, rent reviews would have taken place during the Indemnity

It is hereby mutually agreed that, in the event of payment of a claim under this Section, the Sum Insured

effort to make a full recovery of costs. Where a settlement purports to be a global or a without costs 
settlement, the Insured agrees that the Appointed Representatives appraisal of a fair and reasonable 
proportion of that settlement will be deemed costs and shall be due to the Insurer.

Resist or pursue appeals 
If, the Insured wishes to appeal against the judgement or a decision of the court or tribunal in legal 
proceedings the grounds of that appeal must be submitted to the Claims Manager for its prior written consent

Section II -Liability Coverage 

A. 
Coverage 
We will pay all sums an insured legally must pay 
as damages because of bodily injury or property 
damage to which this insurance applies, caused by 
an accident and resulting from the ownership, 
maintenance or use of a covered auto. 

We will also pay all sums an insured legally must 
pay asa covered pollution cost or expense to which 
this insurance applies, caused by an accident and 
resulting from the ownership, maintenance or use 
of covered autos. However, we will only pay for 
the covered pollution cost or expense if there is either 
bodily injury or property damage to which this 
insurance applies that is caused by the same accident. 


We have the right and duty to defend any insured 
against a suit asking for such damages or a covered 
pollution cost or expense. However, we have no 
duty to defend any insured against a suit seeking 
damages for bodily injury or property damage or a 
covered pollution cost or expense to which this insurance 
does not apply. We may investigate and 
settle any claim or suit as we consider appropriate. 
Our duty to defend or settle ends when the Liability 
Coverage Limit of Insurance has been exhausted 
by payment of judgments or settlements.

to secure our rights and must do nothing after 
accident or loss to impair them. 

B. 
General Conditions 
1. 
Bankruptcy 
Bankruptcy or insolvency of the insured or 
the insureds estate will not relieve us of any 
obligations under this coverage form. 

2. Concealment, Misrepresentation or Fraud 
This coverage form is void in any case of 
fraud by you at any time as it relates to this 
coverage form. It is also void if you or any 
other insured, at any time, intentionally conceal 
or misrepresent a material fact concerning: 


a. 
This coverage form; 
b. 
The covered auto; 
c. 
Your interest in the covered auto; or 
d. 
A claim under this coverage form. 
3. 
Liberalization 
If we revise this coverage form to provide 
more coverage without additional premium 
charge, your policy will automatically provide 
the additional coverage as of the day the revision 
is effective in your state. 

4. 
No Benefit to Bailee -Physical Damage 
Coverages 
We will not recognize any assignment or grant 
any coverage for the benefit of any person or 
organization holding, storing or transporting 
property for a fee regardless of any other provision 
of this coverage form. 

5. 
Other Insurance 
a. 
For any covered auto you own, this 
coverage form provides primary insurance. 
For any covered auto you dont 
own, the insurance provided by this coverage 
form is excess over any other collectible 
insurance. However, while a 
covered auto which is a trailer is connected 
to another vehicle, the Liability 
Coverage this coverage form provides for 
the trailer is: 
(1) 
Excess while it is connected to a 
motor vehicle you do not own. 
(2) 
Primary while it is connected to a 
covered auto you own. 
b. 
For Hired Auto Physical Damage Coverage, 
any covered auto you lease, hire, 
rent or borrow is deemed to be a covered 
auto you own. However, any auto that 
is leased, hired, rented or borrowed with 
a driver is not a covered auto. 
c. 
Regardless of the provisions of Paragraph 
a. above, this coverage forms Liability 
Coverage is primary for any liability assumed 
under an insured contract. 
d. 
When this coverage form and any other 
coverage form or policy covers on the 
same basis, either excess or primary, we 
will pay only our share. Our share is the 
proportion that the Limit of Insurance 
of our coverage form bears to the total 
of the limits of all the coverage forms and 
policies covering on the same basis. 
6. 
Premium Audit 
a. 
The estimated premium for this coverage 
form is based on the exposures you told 
us you would have when this policy began. 
We will compute the final premium 
due when we determine your actual exposures. 
The estimated total premium 
will be credited against the final premium 
due and the first Named Insured will be 
billed for the balance, if any. The due 
date for the final premium or retrospective 
premium is the date shown as the 
due date on the bill. If the estimated total 
premium exceeds the final premium 
due, the first Named Insured will get a 
refund. 
b. 
If this policy is issued for more than one 
year, the premium for this coverage form 
will be computed annually based on our 
rates or premiums in effect at the beginning 
of each year of the policy. 
7.

and losses occurring:

settlement we agree to. 
We also cover loss to, or accidents involving, 
a covered auto while being transported between 
any of these places. 

8. 
Two or More Coverage Forms or Policies Issued 
by Us 
If this coverage form and any other coverage 
form or policy issued to you by us or any 
company affiliated with us applies to the same 
accident, the aggregate maximum Limit of 
Insurance under all the coverage forms or 
policies shall not exceed the highest applicable 
Limit of Insurance under any one coverage 
form or policy. This condition does not apply 
to any coverage form or policy issued by us

1 
Fair Presentation of the Risk 

a 
The 
Insured 
must 
make 
a 
fair 
presentation 
of 
the 
risk 
to 
the 
Insurer 
at 
inception, 
renewal 
and 
variation 
of 
the 
Policy. 


b 
The 
Insurer 
may 
avoid 
the 
Policy 
and 
refuse 
to 
pay 
any 
claims 
where 
any 
failure 
to 
make 
a 
fair 
presentation 
is: 
i deliberate 
or 
reckless; 
or 
ii of 
such 
other 
nature 
that, 
if 
the 
Insured 
had 
made 
a 
fair 


presentation, 
the 
Insurer 
would 
not 
have 
issued 
the 
Policy. 


The 
Insurer 
will 
return 
the 
premium 
paid 
by 
the 
Insured 
unless 


the 
failure 
to 
make 
a 
fair 
presentation 
is 
deliberate 
or 
reckless. 


c 
If 
the 
Insurer 
would 
have 
issued 
the 
Policy 
on 
different 
terms 
had 
the 
Insured 
made 
a 
fair 
presentation, 
the 
Insurer 
will 
not 
avoid 
the 
Policy 
(except 
where 
the 
failure 
is 
deliberate 
or 
reckless) 
but 
the 
Insurer 
may 
instead: 
i reduce 
proportionately 
the 
amount 
paid 
or 
payable 
on 
any 


claim, 
the 
proportion 
for 
which 
the 
Insurer 
is 
liable 
being 
calculated 
by 
comparing 
the 
premium 
actually 
charged 
as 
a 
percentage 
of 
the 
premium 
which 
the 
Insurer 
would 
have 
charged 
had 
the 
Insured 
made 
a 
fair 
presentation; 
and/or 


ii 
treat 
the 
Policy 
as 
if 
it 
had 
included 
such 
additional 
terms 
(other 
than 
those 
requiring 
payment 
of 
premium) 
as 
the 
Insurer 
would 
have 
imposed 
had 
the 
Insured 
made 
a 
fair 
presentation. 


For 
the 
purposes 
of 
this 
condition 
references

a 
Policy 
means 
treating 
the 
Policy 
as 
if 
it

not 
existed 
from 
the 
inception 
date 
(where 
the 
failure 
to 
make 
a 
fair

of 
the 
risk 
occurs 
before 
or 
at 
the 
inception 
of

of 
the

variation 
date 
(where 
the 
failure 
occurs 
when 
the 
Policy 
is 
varied); 


b 
refunds 
of

of

back 
to 
the

date,

date 
or

as 
the

14 Survey and Risk Improvement Condition 
If 
this 
Policy 
has 
been 
issued 
or 
renewed 
subject 
to 
the 
Insurer 
completing 
a 
survey 
or 
surveys 
of 
the 
Premises 
or 
of 
any 
other 
location(s) 
as 
specified 
by 
the 
Insurer, 
then 
pending 
completion 
of 
such 
survey(s) 
cover 
is 
provided 
by 
the 
Insurer 
on 
the 
terms, 
conditions, 
provisions, 
exclusions 
and 
limits 
as 
specified 
in 
the 
Policy 
and 
in 
the 
Sections 
of 
the 
Policy. 


In 
the 
event 
that 
a 
survey 
should 
show 
that 
a 
risk 
or 
any 
part 
of 
it 
is 
not 
satisfactory 
in 
the 
opinion 
of 
the 
Insurer, 
then 
the 
Insurer 
reserves 
the 
right 
to 
either 
alter 
the 
terms 
and 
conditions 
of 
the 
cover 
or 
to 
suspend 
or 
withdraw 
cover 
from 
the 
date 
cover 
was 
incepted 
or 
renewed 
or 
for 
any 
other 
period 
specified 
by 
the 
Insurer. 
It 
is 
a 
condition 
of 
the 
Insurer 
that 
the 
Insured 
must 
comply 
with 
all 
survey 
risk 
improvements 
required 
by 
the 
Insurer 
within 
completion 
time 
scales 
specified 
by 
the 
Insurer. 


In 
the 
event 
that 
a 
risk 
improvement 
is 
not 
completed 
or 
risk 
improvement 
procedures 
are 
not 
introduced 
within 
the 
completion 
time 
scales 
specified 
by 
the 
Insurer, 
then 
the 
Insurer 
reserves 
the 
right 
to 
either 
continue 
cover 
subject 
to 
alteration 
of 
the 
terms 
and 
conditions 
of 
such 
cover, 
or 
to 
suspend 
or 
withdraw 
cover 
effective 


a 
from 
the 
date 
cover 
was 
incepted 
or 
renewed 
or 


b 
from 
the 
expiry 
of 
any 
time 
period 
specified 
by 
the 
Insurer 
for 
completion/introduction 
of 
the 
required 
survey 
risk 
improvements, 


or 


c 
for 
any 
other 
period 
specified 
by 
the 
Insurer 


If 
the 
terms 
or 
conditions 
of 
cover 
are 
amended 
by 
the 
Insurer, 
then 
the 
Insured 
will 
have 
14 
days 
to 
accept 
or 
reject 
the 
revised 
basis 
of 
cover. 


If 
the 
Insured 
elect 
to 
reject 
the 
revised 
basis 
of 
cover, 
then 
provided 
no 
claim 
has 
been 
made 
or 
incident 
has 
arisen 
which 
is 
likely 
to 
give 
rise 
to 
a 
claim 
during 
the 
current 
Period 
of 
Insurance 
the 
Insured 
will 
be 
entitled 
to 
a 
refund 
of 
the 
premium 
paid 
calculated 
on 
a 
pro-rata 
basis, 
less 
an 
administration 
charge 
of

£25 
to 
cover 
operational 
costs. 
The 
amount 
of 
any 
premium 
to 
be 
refunded 
under 
this 
condition 
will 
be 
reduced 
by 
all 
unpaid 
premiums 
or 
unpaid 
premium 
instalments 
due. 


If 
the 
Insurer 
exercises 
the 
right 
to 
suspend 
or 
cancel 
cover, 
then 
provided 
no 
claim 
has 
been 
made 
or 
incident 
has 
arisen 
which 
is 
likely 
to 
give 
rise 
to 
a 
claim 
during 
the 
current 
Period 
of 
Insurance 
the 
Insured 
will 
be 
entitled 
to 
a 
proportionate 
return 
of 
the 
premium 
in 
respect 
of 
such 
period 
that 
cover 
is 
suspended 
or 
for 
any 
period 
beyond 
the 
effective 
date 
from 
which 
cover 
is 
cancelled. 
The 
amount 
of 
premium 
refund 
payable 
will 
be 
reduced 
by 
all 
unpaid 
premiums 
or 
unpaid 
premium 
instalments 
due. 


Except 
in 
so 
far 
as 
they 
are 
expressly 
varied 
by 
this 
condition, 
all 
of 
the 
terms, 
conditions, 
provisions, 
exclusions 
and 
limits 
of 
the 
Policy 
and 
of 
the 
Sections 
of 
the 
Policy 
shall 
continue 
to 
apply 
until 
the 
Insurer 
advises 
otherwise. 
To 
the 
extent 
that 
this 
condition 
conflicts 
with 
any 
other 
cancellation 
condition, 
this 
condition 
shall 
prevail. 


15 Other Insurances 

If 
at 
the 
time 
of 
Damage, 
loss 
or 
injury, 
any 
other 
insurance 
has 
been 
effected 
by 
or 
on 
behalf 
of 
the 
Insured 
covering 
any 
of 
the 
Property 
damaged 
or 
other 
losses 
covered 
by 
this 
Policy, 
the 
Insurer's 
liability 
under 
this 
Policy 
shall 
be 
limited 
to 
the 
rateable 
proportion 
of 
such 
Damage 
or 
loss 
as 
the 
Insurer 
would 
have 
had 
to 
pay 
if 
the 
other 
insurance 
policy 
did 
not 
contain: 


a 
any 
provision 
applying 
average 
or 
any 
similar 
provision 
which 


would 
reduce 
the 
amount 
payable 
on 
the 
claim 
to 
reflect 


underinsurance; 
and 


b 
any 
provision 
which 
excludes 
it 
from 
ranking 
concurrently 


with 
this 
Policy 
or 
any 
Section 
of 
it 
either 
in 
whole 
or 
in 
part 
or 


from 
contributing 
rateably. 


16 Change of Risk 

The 
Insured 
must 
notify 
the 
Insurer 
as 
soon 
as 
possible 
if 
during 
the 
Period 
of 
Insurance 
there 
is 
any 
alteration: 


a in 
or 
to 
the 
Business; 
b to 
or 
at 
the 
Premises; 
c to 
the 
facts 
or 
matters 
set 
out 
in 
the 
Statement 
of 
Fact 
or 
otherwise 
comprising 
the 
risk 
presentation 
made 
by 
the 
Insured 
to 
the 
Insurer 
at 
inception, 
renewal 
or 
variation 
of 
the 
Policy; 
which 
materially 
increases 
the 
risk 
of 
injury, 
loss, 


Damage 
or 
liability. 


Upon 
being 
notified 
of 
any 
such 
alteration, 
the 
Insurer 
may, 
at 
its 
absolute 
discretion: 


a 
continue 
to 
provide 
cover 
under 
this 
Policy 
on 
the 
same 
terms; 


b 
restrict 
the 
cover 
provided 
under 
this 
Policy;. 


c 
impose 
additional 
terms; 


d 
alter 
the 
premium; 


e cancel 
the 
policy. 
If 
the 
Insured 
fails 
to 
notify 
the 
Insurer 
of 
any 
material 
alteration 
of 
the 
risk, 
the 
Insurer 
may: 


a treat 
the 
Policy 
as 
if 
it 
had 
come 
to 
an 
end 
as 
at 
the 
date 
of 
the 
alteration 
of 
the 
risk, 
returning 
a 
proportionate 
amount 
of 
the 
premium 
for 
the 
unexpired 
Period 
of 
Insurance, 
if 
the 
Insurer 
would 
have 
cancelled 
the 
Policy 
had 
it 
known 
of 
the 
increase 
in 
risk; 
b treat 
the 
Policy 
as 
if 
it 
had 
contained 
such 
terms 
(other 
than 
relating 
to 
premium) 
or 
other 
restrictions 
(if 
any) 
from 
the 
date 
of 
the 
alteration 
in 
risk 
as 
the 
Insurer 
would 
have 
applied 
had 
it 
known 
of 
the 
increase 
in 
risk; 
c reduce 
proportionately 
the 
amount 
paid 
or 
payable 
on 
any 
claim, 
the 
proportion 
for 
which 
the 
Insurer 
is 
liable 
being 
calculated 
by 
comparing 
the 
premium 
actually 
charged 
as 
a 
percentage 
of 
the 
premium 
which 
the 
Insurer 
would 
have 
charged 
had 
it 
known 
of 
the 
increase 
in 
risk. 


17 Conditions Precedent to Liability 

If 
the 
Insured 
does 
not 
comply 
with 
any 
part 
of 
any 
condition 
which 
makes 
payment 
of 
a 
claim 
conditional 
upon 
compliance 
with 
it 
(a 
condition 
precedent), 
the 
Insurer 
will 
not 
pay 
for 
any 
claim, 
except 
that 
where 
the 
condition 
concerned: 


a 
operates 
only 
in 
connection 
with 
particular 
premises 
or 
locations, 
the 
Insurer 
will 
pay 
for 
claims 
arising 
out 
of 
an 
event 
occurring 
at 
other 
premises 
or 
locations 
which 
are 
not 
specified 
in 
the 
condition; 


b 
operates 
only 
at 
particular 
times, 
the 
Insurer 
will 
pay 
for 
any 
claim 
where 
the 
Insured 
shows 
on 
the 
balance 
of 
probabilities 
that 
its 
non-compliance 
with 
the 
condition 
did 
not 
cause 
or 
contribute 
to 
the 
injury, 
loss, 
damage 
or 
liability 
which 
occurred; 


c 
would, 
if 
complied 
with, 
tend 
to 
reduce 
particular 
types 
of 
injury, 
loss, 
damage 
or, 
as 
the 
context 
may 
require 
liability, 
the 
Insurer 
will 
pay 
for 
any 
claim 
where 
the 
Insured 
shows 
on 
the 
balance 
of 
probabilities 
that 
its 
non-compliance 
with 
the 
condition 
did 
not 
cause 
or 
contribute 
to 
the 
injury, 
loss, 
damage 
or 
liability 
which 
occurred.

report 
in 
writing 
the 
result 
of 
the 
Claim 
to 
the 
Insurer 
when 
it 
is 
finished. 


e 
Payment of Legal Representatives Bills 
The 
Insurer 
shall 
have 
the 
right 
to 
settle 
Legal 
Expenses 
at 
the 
conclusion 
of 
a 
Claim. 


The 
Insured 
Person 
should 
forward 
all 
bills 
which 
are 
received 
from 
the 
Legal 
Representative 
relating 
to 
the 
Claim 
to 
the 
Insurer 
without 
delay 
following 
conclusion 
of 
the 
Claim. 
If 
the 
Insurer 
requires, 
the 
Insured 
Person 
must 
ask 
the 
Legal 
Representative 
to 
submit 
the 
bill 
of 
costs 
for 
audit 
or 
assessment 
by 
the 
appropriate 
court 
or, 
at 
the 
discretion 
of 
the 
Insurer, 
a 
law 
costs 
draughtsman 
or 
other 
competent 
party. 
The 
Insurer 
will 
only 
pay 
Legal 
Expenses 
that 
are 
determined 
as 
reasonable 
by 
the 
audit 
or 
assessment. 


The 
Insurer 
may 
settle 
a 
payment 
of 
Legal 
Expenses, 
Awards 
of 
Compensation, 
Data 
Protection 
Compensation 
Awards, 
Jury 
Service 
Allowance 
or 
Witness 
Attendance 
Allowance 
direct 
with 
the 
Legal 
Representative 
if 
it 
is 
appropriate 
for 
the 
Insurer 
to 
do 
so. 
The 
payment 
of 
some 
Legal 
Expenses 
does 
not 
imply 
that 
all 
Legal 
Expenses 
will 
be 
paid 
on 
the 
Insured 
Persons 
behalf. 


The 
Insured 
Person 
must 
not, 
without 
the 
Insurers 
prior 
written 
consent, 
enter 
into 
any 
agreement 
with 
the 
Legal 
Representative 
as 
to 
the 
basis 
of 
calculation 
of 
Legal 
Expenses. 
This 
agreement 
is 
normally 
known 
as 
either 
a 
conditional 
fee 
agreement 
or 
a 
damages 
based 
agreement. 


f 
Instruction of a Barrister 
If, 
during 
the 
course 
of 
any 
Claim 
(and 
subject 
always 
to 
compliance 
with 
Claims 
Process 
Condition 
2), 
the 
Insured 
Person 
or 
the 
Legal 
Representative 
considers 
it 
necessary 
and 
wishes 
to 
instruct 
a 
barrister, 
the 
barristers 
name 
must 
first 
be 
submitted 
to 
the 
Insurer 
for 
Consent 
to 
the 
proposed 
instruction. 


It 
is 
a 
condition 
precedent 
to 
the 
Insurers 
continuing 
liability 
to 
provide 
cover 
under 
this 
Section 
that 
the 
Insured 
Person 
i does 
not 
withdraw 
from 
a 
Claim 
or 
dismiss 
the 
Legal 


Representative 
without 
the 
written 
agreement 
of 
the 
Insurer 
and 
the 
Legal 
Representative; 
and 
ii co-operates 
fully 
with 
the 
Legal 
Representative 
and 
the 
Insurer 
in 
the 
conduct 
of 
the 
Claim; 
and 
iii follows 
the 
advice 
of 
the 
Legal 
Representative. 


If 
the 
Insured 
Person 
fails 
to 
comply 
with 
i, 
ii 
or 
iii 
then 
the 
Insurers 
liability 
to 
provide 
cover 
under 
this 
Section 
will 
cease 
immediately 
and 
the 
Insurer 
will 
not 
be 
responsible 
for 
the 
payment 
of 
Legal 
Expenses, 
Awards 
of 
Compensation 
or 
Data 
Protection 
Compensation 
Awards 
and 
will 
be 
entitled 
to 
reimbursement 
of 
all 
Legal 
Expenses 
already 
incurred 
and 
any 
Jury 
Service 
Allowance 
or 
Witness 
Attendance 
Allowance 
already 
paid 
in 
respect 
of 
the 
Claim 
unless 
the 
Insurer 
agrees 
to 
appoint 
another 
Legal 
Representative 
to 
continue 
the 
Claim. 


h 
Award of Costs 
Where 
the 
Insured 
Person 
is 
awarded 
costs, 
it 
is 
a 
condition 
precedent 
to 
the 
Insurers 
liability 
to 
provide 
cover 
for 
Legal 
Expenses 
that 
the 
Insured 
Person 
and 
the 
Legal 
Representative 
must 
take 
every 
reasonable 
step 
to 
recover 
Legal 
Expenses 
which 
would 
be 
or 
have 
been 
subject 
to 
payment 
under 
this 
Section. 
All 
such 
recoveries 
will 
be 
taken 
into 
account 
when 
calculating 
the 
Insurers 
liability 
under 
this 
Section. 


i 
Alternative Dispute Resolution 
When, 
in 
the 
Insurers 
opinion, 
alternative 
dispute 
resolution 
would 
appear 
to 
provide 
a 
more 
effective 
method 
of 
resolving 
any 
Claim, 
the 
Insurer 
may 
request 
that 
the 
Insured 
Person 
agrees 
to 
submit 
such 
Claim 
to 
a 
professional 
dispute 
resolution 
service, 
to 
be 
selected 
by 
the 
Insurer. 


In 
considering 
alternative 
dispute 
resolution 
the 
Insured 
Person 
will 
comply 
with 
Claims 
Process 
Condition 
4 
and 
will 
not 
therefore 
unreasonably 
withhold 
Consent.

document. It is an important document so You should keep it somewhere safe  You will need it if You 
need to make a claim. 

 

 

Please read it carefully to make sure that it meets Your 
requirements and that the details on the Policy Schedule and 
Statement of Facts are correct. 

Your premium has been based upon the information shown in the 
Policy Schedule and recorded in Your Statement of Facts. 

If after reading Your Policy Wording You have any questions, any 
details are incorrect or the Policy does not provide the cover You 
need then You must contact Your insurance adviser immediately.

How to make a claim 

If You need to make a legal expenses claim and this section is 
shown as being operative on the Schedule, please refer to the 
Legal Expenses Insurance Section of this Policy for details. For all 
other claims please contact Us by calling the telephone number 
printed on Your Policy Schedule. 

The claims handler will take full details of the claim and guide You 
through the next steps. Depending on the value and type of claim, 
the claims handler may seek help from a loss adjuster. Loss 
adjusters are independent claims experts who will visit You or a 
third party claimant to assist with the assessment of the claim. 

Once We have been notified of a claim, We will tell Your broker. 
The notification letter gives Your broker the opportunity to become 
involved in the claim if either You or they wish. Once the claim has 
been settled, a letter is sent to Your broker confirming settlement 
and the amounts paid. 

Do 

 Have details of Your policy number ready when notifying Us. 


You can find the policy number on the Schedule. 

 Report any incidence of loss of Money, theft, attempted theft 
or Damage by malicious persons to the police immediately. 
You should obtain a crime reference number (not an incident 
reference number) from them if a crime has been committed. 
 Carry out temporary repairs to the Property Insured to 
prevent further loss. Please retain all invoices for work 
carried out. Remember, if You do not have Your own 
contractor, call the Business Emergency Assistance 
telephone no. on Your Schedule to arrange for an approved 
contractor to effect repairs, any time of the day or night. 
 Notify Us of any claim or any incident which may lead to a 
claim as soon as possible. The sooner We are involved, the 
more opportunity We have to resolve the claim to Your 
satisfaction. You must notify Us within seven days if the 
incident relates to Damage by riot, civil commotion, labour or 
political disturbances, malicious persons, theft or attempted 
theft. 
 Ensure that any letter or notice received is sent to Us 
immediately unanswered and unacknowledged. You must 
also send Us unanswered and unacknowledged any written 
claim, writ, summons or other document relating to a claim 
and tell Us of any pending prosecution, coroners inquest or 
fatal accident inquiry and give Us full details of any verbal 
claims made against You. 
 Any Bodily Injury to an Employee should be reported to Us 
regardless of whether a formal claim has been made against 
You. We can then decide whether We need to investigate 
and provide advice to You. 


Dont 

 Dispose of any evidence or damaged items - We may wish to 
see them. 
 Wait for estimates to be obtained for work to be carried out 
before notifying Us of a claim. 
 Admit or deny responsibility for any incident involving Bodily 


Injury to others or Damage to their property. 

 

Replacement service 

We have a number of suppliers that can repair the Property 
Insured or replace items lost, stolen or damaged beyond 
repair. If one of Our suppliers is used You will not need to 
obtain estimates and We will settle directly with the supplier. 
You will be responsible for the payment of any applicable 
Excess. You will only be responsible for payment of the VAT 
element if You are VAT registered. You will be invoiced 
accordingly.

POLICY INTRODUCTION 

 

The Contract of Insurance 

Your Policy is a contract between Us, the insurers, and You, 
the Policyholder. 

In return for You having paid or agreed to pay the premium, 
We will indemnify You by payment or, at Our option, by 
reinstatement or repair, in respect of loss, destruction, 
damage, accident or injury occurring or other insured 
contingency arising during the Period of Insurance, subject to 
the terms conditions and exclusions contained in the Policy 
and endorsed on The Schedule. 

 

Important 

You are required to make a fair presentation of the risk to Us. 

If You breach Your duty to provide a fair presentation and any 
such breach was deliberate or reckless, We may regard the 
Policy as void and are not required to return any paid Premium 
to You. 

If the breach was not deliberate or reckless, Our remedy shall 
depend upon what We would have done if You had complied 
with the duty of fair presentation: 

1. We may regard the Policy as void if Insurers would not 




have entered into the Policy on any terms in the absence of 
the breach. In this case, We must return the premium paid. 

2. If We would have entered into the Policy, but on different 
terms (other than terms relating to premium) the Policy is to 
be treated as if those different terms applied from the 
outset, if We so require. 
3. If We would have entered into the Policy but would have 
charged a higher premium We may reduce proportionately 
the amount to be paid on a claim (and, if applicable, the 
amount already paid on prior claims) 




Choice of Law 

1. This Policy will be governed by English Law, and You and 
We agree to submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the 
courts of England and Wales (unless You live in Jersey in 
which case the law of Jersey will apply and the Jersey 
courts will have exclusive jurisdiction).

POLICY CONDITIONS 

Each Section of the Policy contains Conditions. They must be 
read in conjunction with the following Policy Conditions which 
apply to all Sections, other than Legal Expenses Insurance 
Section, unless otherwise stated. 

Where: (i) there has been a failure to comply with a term (express 
or implied) of this Policy, other than a term which defines the risk 
as a whole; and (ii) compliance with such term would tend to 
reduce the risk of loss of a particular kind and/or loss at a 
particular location and/or loss at a particular time, We cannot rely 
on the breach of such term to exclude, limit or discharge its 
liability if You show that the failure to comply with such term 

could not have increased the risk of the loss which actually 
occurred in the circumstances in which it occurred. 

If You breach any warranty in this Policy, Our liability under the 
Policy shall be suspended from the time of the breach until the 
time when the breach is remedied (if it is capable of being 
remedied). We will have no liability to You for any loss which 
occurs, or which is attributable to something happening, during 
the period when Our liability is suspended 

 

(1) Alteration of risk 

If (a) there has been any alteration to the Property Insured 
and, or The Premises and, or The Business after the 
effective date of this insurance which increases the risk 
of loss, liability, destruction, damage, accident or injury 

or 

 

(b) Your interest ceases except by will or operation of law 

 

We will at Our option avoid the Policy from the date of such 
alteration or when Your interest ceases. 

 

(2) Arbitration 

If We accept liability but You disagree with the amount We offer to 
pay, the claim will be referred to an arbitrator who will be 
appointed in accordance with statutory provisions. 

 

(3) Cancellation 

Following the expiry of Your Statutory 14 day right to cancel (also 
known as the cooling-off period), You continue to have the right 
to cancel Your policy at any time during its term. 

If You do cancel Your Policy after the cooling-off period, You 
will be entitled to a refund of the premium You paid subject to a 
deduction for the time for which You have been covered. This will 
be calculated in proportion to the period for which You have been 
on cover. 

 

If You wish to cancel Your Policy at any time, please contact 

Your insurance adviser. 

 

We may cancel the Policy 

(a) by sending You 30 days written notice to Your last known 
address 






We will refund a proportionate part of the premium paid 
for the unexpired period, provided that no claims have 
been paid or are outstanding during the Period of 
Insurance. 

(b) immediately if the premium has not been paid or if there 
has been a default under an instalment or linked credit 
agreement. 






We will not refund any instalment paid and at Our discretion may 
request full payment of the annual premium if any claims have 
been paid or are outstanding during the Period of Insurance. 

 

Other reasons for cancellation under this Condition may include 
but are not limited to: 

(a) a change to the risk which makes it one We would not 
normally accept 
(b) You failing to co-operate with or provide information to Us 


which affects Our ability to underwrite the risk. 

 

 

(4) Contribution 

Applicable to the Employers Liability Section and Property 
Owners Liability Section 

(a) If the insurance provided by these Sections is also covered 
by another Policy (or would be but for the existence of these

excess beyond the amount which would be payable under 
such other insurance had these Sections not been effected. 






 

Applicable to all other Sections insured by this Policy other 
than Legal Expenses Insurance Section 

(b) Where any loss, destruction, damage or liability covered by 
the Policy is also covered by another Policy, (or would be 
but for the existence of this Policy), We will only pay a 
rateable share of the loss. 
(c) If the other insurance is subject to a condition of Average 
and this Policy is not, this Policy will become subject to the 
same condition of Average. 
(d) If the Property Insured covered by the other insurance is 
subject to a provision excluding proportional payment in 
whole or in part, the payment We make will be limited to 
the proportion of loss, destruction or damage as the Sum 
Insured bears to the value of the property. 






 

(5) Discharge of Liability 

We may at any time pay 

(a) the Limit of Indemnity 






or 

(b) the Sum Insured 






or 

(c) a smaller amount for which a claim can be settled, after

and expense, do everything We reasonably require to

GUIDE TO THIS POLICY 
This is your Commercial Property Policy, a legal 
document which sets out the insurance cover you have 
requested and which we have agreed to provide. 
Like most commercial policies, the language of this 
Policy is quite formal. Please read it carefully, including 
the Schedule, and ensure you understand it fully. Please 
contact your insurance broker immediately if anything 
needs correcting, or if anything is not clear to you. 
The Policy has separate sections for the different types of 
cover you may have purchased. In each section is an 
insuring clause which, with any Extensions, set out the 
initial scope of cover. Then there are Exceptions, which 
exclude certain elements of that cover. Finally there are 
Conditions, which contain important provisions which 
you should comply with in order to avoid potential 
problems. 
The policy has a private dictionary  words with a 
special meaning are listed in alphabetical order in the 
definitions section, and those words always appear with a 
capital letter. Also, there are some extensions, exceptions 
and conditions that apply to more than one Section, and 
to enable you to find the relevant clauses there are 
signposts where necessary.

J. 
"Your covered auto" means: 
1. 
Any vehicle shown in the Declarations.

A "newly acquired auto". 
3. 
Any "trailer" you own. 
4. 
Any auto or "trailer" you do not own while used 
as a temporary substitute for any other vehicle 
described in this definition which is out of normal 
use because of its: 
a. 
Breakdown; 
b. 
Repair; 
c. 
Servicing; 
d. 
Loss; or 
e.

K. 
"Newly acquired auto": 
1. 
"Newly acquired auto" means any of the following 
types of vehicles you become the owner of 
during the policy period: 
a. 
A private passenger auto; or

policy provides coverage, that: 
(1) 
Has a Gross Vehicle Weight of less

of goods and materials unless 
such use is:

2. 
Coverage for a "newly acquired auto" is provided

coverage we provide for a "newly acquired 
auto" will begin at the time you request the 
coverage. 
a. 
For any coverage provided in this policy 
except Coverage For Damage To Your 
Auto, a "newly acquired auto" will have the 
broadest coverage we now provide for any 
vehicle shown in the Declarations. Coverage 
begins on the date you become the 
owner. However, for this coverage to apply

days after you become the owner.

If a "newly acquired auto" replaces a vehicle 
shown in the Declarations, coverage is 
provided for this vehicle without your having

provide for any auto shown in the Declarations. 
(2) 
Four days after you become the owner 
if the Declarations do not indicate that 
Collision Coverage applies to at least

you asked us to insure the "newly acquired 
auto", a Collision deductible of 
$500 will apply. 
c. 
Other Than Collision Coverage for a "newly 
acquired auto" begins on the date you become 
the owner. However, for this coverage 
to apply, you must ask us to insure it 
within: 
(1) 
14 days after you become the owner if 
the Declarations indicate that Other 
Than Collision Coverage applies to at 
least one auto. In this case, the "newly 
acquired auto" will have the broadest 
coverage we now provide for any auto 
shown in the Declarations. 
(2) 
Four days after you become the owner 
if the Declarations do not indicate that 
Other Than Collision Coverage applies 
to at least one auto. If you comply with 
the 4 day requirement and a loss occurred 
before you asked us to insure the 
"newly acquired auto", an Other Than 
Collision deductible of $500 will apply. 
PART A  LIABILITY COVERAGE 


INSURING AGREEMENT 

A. 
We will pay damages for "bodily injury" or 
"property damage" for which any "insured" becomes 
legally responsible because of an auto accident. 
Damages include prejudgment interest 
awarded against the "insured". We will settle or 
defend, as we consider appropriate, any claim or 
suit asking for these damages. In addition to our 
limit of liability, we will pay all defense costs we 
incur. Our duty to settle or defend ends when our 
limit of liability for this coverage has been exhausted 
by payment of judgments or settlements. 
We have no duty to defend any suit or settle any 
claim for "bodily injury" or "property damage" not 
covered under this policy. 
B. 
"Insured" as used in this Part means: 
1. 
You or any "family member" for the ownership, 
maintenance or use of any auto or "trailer". 
2. 
Any person using "your covered auto". 
3. 
For "your covered auto", any person or organization 
but only with respect to legal responsibility 
for acts or omissions of a person for 
whom coverage is afforded under this Part. 
4. 
For any auto or "trailer", other than "your covered 
auto", any other person or organization 
but only with respect to legal responsibility for 
acts or omissions of you or any "family member" 
for whom coverage is afforded under this 
Part. This Provision (B.4.) applies only if the 
person or organization does not own or hire the 
auto or "trailer". 
SUPPLEMENTARY PAYMENTS 

In addition to our limit of liability, we will pay on behalf 
of an "insured": 

1. 
Up to $250 for the cost of bail bonds required 
because of an accident, including related traffic 
law violations. The accident must result in 
"bodily injury" or "property damage" covered 
under this policy. 
2. 
Premiums on appeal bonds and bonds to release 
attachments in any suit we defend. 
3. 
Interest accruing after a judgment is entered in 
any suit we defend. Our duty to pay interest 
ends when we offer to pay that part of the 
judgment which does not exceed our limit of liability 
for this coverage. 
4. 
Up to $200 a day for loss of earnings, but not 
other income, because of attendance at hearings 
or trials at our request. 
5. 
Other reasonable expenses incurred at our 
request. 
EXCLUSIONS 

A. 
We do not provide Liability Coverage for any 
"insured": 
1. 
Who intentionally causes "bodily injury" or 
"property damage". 
2. 
For "property damage" to property owned or

A. 
The limit of liability shown in the Declarations for 
each person for Bodily Injury Liability is our

person in any one auto accident. Subject to this 
limit for each person, the limit of liability shown in 
the Declarations for each accident for Bodily Injury 
Liability is our maximum limit of liability for all 
damages for "bodily injury" resulting from any one 
auto accident. 
The limit of liability shown in the Declarations for 
each accident for Property Damage Liability is our

If an auto accident to which this policy applies occurs 
in any state or province other than the one in which

interpret your policy for that accident as follows: 

A. 
If the state or province has: 
1. 
A financial responsibility or similar law specifying 
limits of liability for "bodily injury" or 
"property damage" higher than the limit shown 
in the Declarations, your policy will provide the 
higher specified limit. 
2. 
A compulsory insurance or similar law requiring 
a nonresident to maintain insurance whenever 
the nonresident uses a vehicle in that 
state or province, your policy will provide at 
least the required minimum amounts and types 
of coverage.

No one will be entitled to duplicate payments for 
the same elements of loss. 
FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY 

When this policy is certified as future proof of financial

by that "insured"; 
from the owner or operator of an "uninsured motor

Both parties must agree to arbitration. If so

two arbitrators will select a third. If they cannot 
agree within 30 days, either may request that selection 
be made by a judge of a court having jurisdiction.

responsibility law of the state in which 
"your covered auto" is principally garaged. If 
the amount exceeds that limit, either party may

12. 
Loss to any "non-owned auto" being maintained 
or used by any person while employed 
or otherwise engaged in the "business" of: 
a. 
Selling; 
b. 
Repairing;

Servicing;

LIMIT OF LIABILITY 

A. 
Our limit of liability for loss will be the lesser of 
the:

Actual cash value of the stolen or damaged 
property; or 
2. 
Amount necessary to repair or replace the 
property with other property of like kind and 
quality. 
However, the most we will pay for loss to: 

1. 
Any "non-owned auto" which is a trailer is 
$500. 
2. 
Equipment designed solely for the reproduction 
of sound, including any accessories used 
with such equipment, which is installed in locations 
not used by the auto manufacturer for 
installation of such equipment or accessories, 
is $1,000. 
B. 
An adjustment for depreciation and physical 
condition will be made in determining actual cash 
value in the event of a total loss. 
C. 
If a repair or replacement results in better than 
like kind or quality, we will not pay for the amount 
of the betterment.

PAYMENT OF LOSS 

We may pay for loss in money or repair or replace 
the damaged or stolen property. We may, at our 
expense, return any stolen property to: 

1. 
You; or 
2. 
The address shown in this policy. 
If we return stolen property we will pay for any damage 
resulting from the theft. We may keep all or part 
of the property at an agreed or appraised value. 

If we pay for loss in money, our payment will include 
the applicable sales tax for the damaged or stolen 
property. 

NO BENEFIT TO BAILEE 

This insurance shall not directly or indirectly benefit 
any carrier or other bailee for hire. 

OTHER SOURCES OF RECOVERY 

If other sources of recovery also cover the loss, we 
will pay only our share of the loss. Our share is the 
proportion that our limit of liability bears to the total of 
all applicable limits. However, any insurance we 
provide with respect to a "non-owned auto" shall be 
excess over any other collectible source of recovery 
including, but not limited to: 

1. 
Any coverage provided by the owner of the 
"non-owned auto"; 
2. 
Any other applicable physical damage insurance; 
3. 
Any other source of recovery applicable to the 
loss. 
APPRAISAL 

A. 
If we and you do not agree on the amount of loss, 
either may demand an appraisal of the loss. In 
this event, each party will select a competent appraiser. 
The two appraisers will select an umpire. 
The appraisers will state separately the actual 
cash value and the amount of loss. If they fail to 
agree, they will submit their differences to the 
umpire. A decision agreed to by any two will be 
binding. Each party will: 
1. 
Pay its chosen appraiser; and 
2. 
Bear the expenses of the appraisal and umpire 
equally. 
B. 
We do not waive any of our rights under this policy 
by agreeing to an appraisal. 
PART E  DUTIES AFTER AN ACCIDENT OR LOSS 


We have no duty to provide coverage under this 
policy unless there has been full compliance with the 
following duties: 

A. 
We must be notified promptly of how, when and 
where the accident or loss happened. Notice 
should also include the names and addresses of 
any injured persons and of any witnesses. 
B. 
A person seeking any coverage must: 
1. 
Cooperate with us in the investigation, settlement 
or defense of any claim or suit. 
2. 
Promptly send us copies of any notices or 
legal papers received in connection with the 
accident or loss. 
3. 
Submit, as often as we reasonably require: 
a. 
To physical exams by physicians we select. 
We will pay for these exams. 
b. 
To examination under oath and subscribe 
the same. 
4. 
Authorize us to obtain: 
a. 
Medical reports; and 
b. 
Other pertinent records. 
5. Submit a proof of loss when required by us. 
C. 
A person seeking Uninsured Motorists Coverage 
must also: 
1. 
Promptly notify the police if a hit-and-run 
driver is involved. 
2. 
Promptly send us copies of the legal papers if 
a suit is brought. 
D. 
A person seeking Coverage For Damage To Your 
Auto must also: 
1. 
Take reasonable steps after loss to protect 
"your covered auto" or any "non-owned auto" 
and their equipment from further loss. We will 
pay reasonable expenses incurred to do this. 
2. 
Promptly notify the police if "your covered 
auto" or any "non-owned auto" is stolen. 
3. 
Permit us to inspect and appraise the damaged 
property before its repair or disposal.

PART F  GENERAL PROVISIONS 


BANKRUPTCY 
OUR RIGHT TO RECOVER PAYMENT 


Bankruptcy or insolvency of the "insured" shall not 
relieve us of any obligations under this policy. 

CHANGES 

A. 
This policy contains all the agreements between 
you and us. Its terms may not be changed or 
waived except by endorsement issued by us. 
B. 
If there is a change to the information used to 
develop the policy premium, we may adjust your 
premium. Changes during the policy term that 
may result in a premium increase or decrease include, 
but are not limited to, changes in: 
1. 
The number, type or use classification of insured 
vehicles; 
2. 
Operators using insured vehicles; 
3. 
The place of principal garaging of insured 
vehicles; 
4. 
Coverage, deductible or limits. 
If a change resulting from A. or B. requires a premium 
adjustment, we will make the premium adjustment 
in accordance with our manual rules. 

C. 
If we make a change which broadens coverage 
under this edition of your policy without additional 
premium charge, that change will automatically 
apply to your policy as of the date we implement 
the change in your state. This Paragraph (C.) 
does not apply to changes implemented with a 
general program revision that includes both 
broadenings and restrictions in coverage, whether 
that general program revision is implemented 
through introduction of: 
1. 
A subsequent edition of your policy; or 
2. An Amendatory Endorsement. 
FRAUD 
We do not provide coverage for any "insured" who 
has made fraudulent statements or engaged in 
fraudulent conduct in connection with any accident or 
loss for which coverage is sought under this policy. 

LEGAL ACTION AGAINST US 

A. 
No legal action may be brought against us until 
there has been full compliance with all the terms 
of this policy. In addition, under Part A, no legal 
action may be brought against us until: 
1. 
We agree in writing that the "insured" has an 
obligation to pay; or 
2. 
The amount of that obligation has been finally 
determined by judgment after trial. 
B. 
No person or organization has any right under this 
policy to bring us into any action to determine the 
liability of an "insured". 
A. 
If we make a payment under this policy and the 
person to or for whom payment was made has a 
right to recover damages from another we shall be 
subrogated to that right. That person shall do: 
1. 
Whatever is necessary to enable us to exercise 
our rights; and 
2. 
Nothing after loss to prejudice them. 
However, our rights in this Paragraph (A.) do not 
apply under Part D, against any person using 
"your covered auto" with a reasonable belief that 
that person is entitled to do so. 

B. 
If we make a payment under this policy and the 
person to or for whom payment is made recovers 
damages from another, that person shall: 
1. 
Hold in trust for us the proceeds of the recovery; 
and 
2. Reimburse us to the extent of our payment. 
POLICY PERIOD AND TERRITORY 
A. 
This policy applies only to accidents and losses 
which occur: 
1. 
During the policy period as shown in the Declarations; 
and 
2. 
Within the policy territory. 
B. 
The policy territory is: 
1. 
The United States of America, its territories or 
possessions; 
2. 
Puerto Rico; or 
3. 
Canada. 
This policy also applies to loss to, or accidents involving, 
"your covered auto" while being transported 
between their ports. 

TERMINATION 

A. Cancellation 
This policy may be cancelled during the policy 
period as follows: 

1. 
The named insured shown in the Declarations 
may cancel by: 
a. 
Returning this policy to us; or 
b. 
Giving us advance written notice of the 
date cancellation is to take effect. 
2. 
We may cancel by mailing to the named insured 
shown in the Declarations at the address 
shown in this policy: 
a. 
At least 10 days notice: 
(1) 
If cancellation is for nonpayment of 
premium; or 
PP 00 01 06 98 Copyright, Insurance Services Office, Inc., 1997 
Page 11 of 12 


(2) 
If notice is mailed during the first 60 
days this policy is in effect and this is 
not a renewal or continuation policy; or 
b. 
At least 20 days notice in all other cases. 
3. 
After this policy is in effect for 60 days, or if 
this is a renewal or continuation policy, we will 
cancel only: 
a. 
For nonpayment of premium; or 
b. 
If your driver's license or that of: 
(1) 
Any driver who lives with you; or 
(2) 
Any driver who customarily uses "your 
covered auto"; 
has been suspended or revoked. This must 
have occurred: 

(1) 
During the policy period; or 
(2) 
Since the last anniversary of the original 
effective date if the policy period is 
other than 1 year; or 
c. 
If the policy was obtained through material 
misrepresentation. 
B. Nonrenewal 
If we decide not to renew or continue this policy, 
we will mail notice to the named insured shown in 
the Declarations at the address shown in this policy. 
Notice will be mailed at least 20 days before 
the end of the policy period. Subject to this notice 
requirement, if the policy period is: 

1. 
Less than 6 months, we will have the right not 
to renew or continue this policy every 6 
months, beginning 6 months after its original 
effective date. 
2. 
6 months or longer, but less than one year, we 
will have the right not to renew or continue this 
policy at the end of the policy period. 
3. 
1 year or longer, we will have the right not to 
renew or continue this policy at each anniversary 
of its original effective date. 
C. Automatic Termination 
If we offer to renew or continue and you or your 
representative do not accept, this policy will 
automatically terminate at the end of the current 
policy period. Failure to pay the required renewal 
or continuation premium when due shall mean 
that you have not accepted our offer. 

If you obtain other insurance on "your covered 
auto", any similar insurance provided by this policy 
will terminate as to that auto on the effective 
date of the other insurance. 

D. Other Termination Provisions 
1. 
We may deliver any notice instead of mailing 
it. Proof of mailing of any notice shall be sufficient 
proof of notice. 
2. 
If this policy is cancelled, you may be entitled 
to a premium refund. If so, we will send you 
the refund. The premium refund, if any, will be 
computed according to our manuals. However, 
making or offering to make the refund is not a 
condition of cancellation. 
3. 
The effective date of cancellation stated in the 
notice shall become the end of the policy period. 
TRANSFER OF YOUR INTEREST IN THIS POLICY 

A. 
Your rights and duties under this policy may not 
be assigned without our written consent. However, 
if a named insured shown in the Declarations dies, 
coverage will be provided for: 
1. 
The surviving spouse if resident in the same 
household at the time of death. Coverage applies 
to the spouse as if a named insured 
shown in the Declarations; and 
2. 
The legal representative of the deceased person 
as if a named insured shown in the Declarations. 
This applies only with respect to the 
representative's legal responsibility to maintain 
or use "your covered auto". 
B. 
Coverage will only be provided until the end of the 
policy period. 
TWO OR MORE AUTO POLICIES 

If this policy and any other auto insurance policy 
issued to you by us apply to the same accident, the 
maximum limit of our liability under all the policies 
shall not exceed the highest applicable limit of liability 
under any one policy.

which 
the

would 
have 
charged 
had

ii 
treat

as 
if 
it 
had 
included 
such 
additional 
terms 
(other 
than 
those 
requiring 
payment 
of 
premium) 
as 
the

have 
imposed 
had

which 
the 
Insured 
or 
anyone 
acting

of 
the

makes 
any 
payment. 


The

agrees 
to 
waive

or 
surveys 
of 
the 
Premises 
or 
of 
any 
other 
location(s) 
as 
specified 
by

that 
a

should 
show 
that 
a 
risk 
or 
any 
part 
of 
it 
is 
not 
satisfactory 
in 
the 
opinion 
of 
the

to 
either 
alter

Insured 
may 
be

advises 
otherwise. 


To 
the

that 
this 
condition

with 
any 
other 
cancellation 
condition,

15Other 
Insurances 
If 
at

there 
is 
any 
other 
insurance 
covering 
such 
incidents, 
the 
Insurer 
will 
only 
pay 
their 
rateable 
proportion 
of 
such 
loss. 


16 
Change 
of 
Risk 
The 
Insured 
must 
notify 
the 
Insurer 
as 
soon 
as 
possible 
if 
during

there 
is 
any 
alteration: 


a 
in 
or 
to 
the 
Business; 


b 
to 
or 
at 
the 
Premises; 


c 
to 
the 
facts 
or 
matters 
set 
out 
in 
the 
Statement 
of 
Fact 
or 
otherwise 
comprising 
the 
risk 
presentation 
made 
by 
the 
Insured 
to 
the 
Insurer 
at 
inception, 
renewal 
or 
variation 
of 
the 
Policy; 
which 
materially 
increases 
the 
risk 
of 
injury, 
loss, 
Damage 
or 
liability. 


Upon 
being 
notified 
of 
any 
such 
alteration, 
the 
Insurer 


may, 
at 
its 
absolute 
discretion: 


a 
continue 
to 
provide 
cover 
under 
this 
Policy 
on 
the 
same 
terms; 


b 
restrict 
the 
cover 
provided 
under 
this 
Policy;. 


c 
impose 
additional 
terms; 


d 
alter 
the 
premium; 


e 
cancel 
the 
policy. 


If 
the 
Insured 
fails 
to 
notify 
the 
Insurer 
of 
any 
material 


alteration 
of 
the 
risk, 
the 
Insurer 
may: 


a 
treat 
the 
Policy 
as 
if 
it 
had 
come 
to 
an 
end 
as 
at 
the 
date 
of 
the 
alteration 
of 
the 
risk, 
returning 
a 
proportionate 
amount 
of 
the 
premium 
for 
the 
unexpired 
Period 
of 
Insurance, 
if 
the 
Insurer 
would 
have 
cancelled 
the 
Policy 
had 
it 
known 
of 
the 
increase 
in 
risk;

b 
treat 
the

as 
if 
it 
had 
contained 
such 
terms 
(other 
than 
relating 
to 
premium) 
or 
other 
restrictions 
(if 
any) 
from 
the 
date 
of 
the 
alteration 
in 
risk 
as 
the 
Insurer 
would 
have 
applied 
had 
it 
known 
of 
the 
increase 
in 
risk; 


c 
reduce 
proportionately 
the 
amount 
paid 
or 
payable 
on 
any 
claim, 
the 
proportion 
for 
which 
the 
Insurer 
is 
liable 
being 
calculated 
by 
comparing 
the 
premium 
actually 
charged 
as 
a 
percentage 
of 
the 
premium 
which 
the 
Insurer 
would 
have 
charged 
had 
it 
known 
of 
the 
increase 
in 
risk. 


17ConditionsPrecedenttoLiability 
If 
the 
Insured 
does 
not 
comply 
with 
any 
part 
of 
any 
condition 
which 
makes 
payment 
of 
a 
claim 
conditional 
upon 
compliance 
with 
it 
(a 
condition 
precedent),

only 
at 
particular 
times, 
the 
Insurer 
will 
pay

any 
claim 
where

the 
balance

non-compliance 
with 
the 
condition 
did 
not 
cause 
or 
contribute 
to 
the 
injury, 
loss,

which 
occurred; 


c 
would, 
if 
complied 
with, 
tend 
to 
reduce 
particular 
types 
of 
injury, 
loss, 
damage 
or, 
as 
the 
context 
may 
require 
liability, 
the 
Insurer 
will 
pay 
for 
any 
claim 
where 
the 
Insured 
shows 
on 
the 
balance 
of 
probabilities 
that 
its 
non-compliance 
with 
the 
condition 
did 
not 
cause 
or 
contribute 
to 
the 
injury, 
loss, 
damage

which 
occurred.

or 
should 
have 
been, 
aware 
of 
any 
cause, 
event 
or 
circumstance 
which 
has 
given 
or 
may 
give

or 
circumstance 
during 
the

of 
Insurance 
any 
Claim 
arising 
from 
that 
cause, 
event 
or 
circumstance 
will 
not 
be 
accepted. 
When 
such 
a 
notification 
has 
been 
given, 
the 
Insurer 
agrees 
to 
treat 
any 
subsequent 
Claim 
in 
respect 
of 
the 
cause, 
event 
or

Form 
(ET1) 
is 
received 
from 
an

must 
immediately 
complete 
a

form 
and 
forward 
it 
to 
the 
Insurer, 
to 
arrive 
no 
later 
than 
seven 
(7) 
days 
after

Response 
Form 
(ET3), 
which 
should 
be 
left 
blank, 
must 
also 
be 
sent. 


It 
is 
a 
condition 
precedent 
to 
the 
liability 
of 
the 
Insurer 
to 
provide 
cover 
under 
this 
Section 
that 
consent 
to 
accept 
a 
claim 
and: 


a 
incur 
Legal 
Expenses; 
and 


b 
pay 
Awards 
of 
Compensation, 
Data 
Protection 
Compensation 
Awards, 
Jury 
Service 
Allowance 
or 
Witness 
Attendance 
Allowance 


must 
first 
be 
obtained 
in 
writing 
from 
the 
Insurer 
(Consent). 
Consent 
will 
be 
given 
if 
the 
Insured 
Person 
can 
satisfy 
the 
Insurer 
that: 


a 
there 
are 
Reasonable 
Prospects 
of 
a 
Satisfactory 
Outcome 
and 


b 
in 
a 
particular 
case, 
it 
is 
reasonable 
for 
Legal 
Expenses 
to 
be 
incurred 
and/or 
a 
Claim 
in 
respect 
of 
Awards 
of 
Compensation, 
Data 
Protection 
Compensation 
Awards, 
Jury 
Service 
Allowance 
or 
Witness 
Attendance 
Allowance 
be 
accepted 
under 
this 
Section. 


In 
reaching 
a 
decision 
on 
whether 
or 
not 
to 
give 
Consent 
the 
Insurer 
will 
seek 
the 
opinion 
of 
the 
Legal 
Representative. 


If 
the 
Insurer 
and 
the 
Legal 
Representative 
are 
unable 
to 
agree 
on 
whether 
Reasonable 
Prospects 
of 
a 
Satisfactory 
Outcome 
exist, 
the 
Insurer 
will 
seek 
the 
opinion 
of 
any 
other 
legally 
qualified 
advisor 
or 
other 
expert 
appropriate 
to 
the 
Claim 
they 
feel 
it 
is 
necessary 
to 
consult 
in 
order 
to 
make 
their 
decision. 


In 
all 
cases 
the 
Insured 
Person 
will 
be 
advised 
in 
writing 
of 
the 
granting 
or 
refusal 
of 
Consent. 


3 
Dealing 
with 
the 
Claim 
If 
the 
Insurer 
grants 
Consent 
a 
Legal 
Representative 
will 
be 
instructed 
and 
will 
then 
act 
in 
accordance 
with 
Claims 
Process 
Condition 
8. 


The 
Insurer 
may 
withdraw 
Consent 
previously 
given 
at 
any 
time 
if 
facts 
become 
known 
which 
would 
mean 
that 
a 
particular 
Claim 
would 
not 
have 
been 
accepted 
under 
the 
terms 
of 
this 
Section 
or 
if 
there 
are 
no 
longer 
Reasonable 
Prospects 
of 
a 
Satisfactory 
Outcome. 
Provided 
there 
has 
been 
full 
compliance 
with 
the 
Section 
terms 
the 
Insurer 
agrees 
to 
indemnify 
the 
Insured 
Person 
in 
respect 
of 
Legal 
Expenses 
incurred 
up 
to 
the 
date 
when 
the 
Insurer 
notified 
the 
Insured 
Person 
that 
Consent 
had 
been 
withdrawn.

Commercial

Expenses 


(continued) 


If 
the 
Insured 
Person 
fails 
to 
comply 
with 
either 
i, 
ii 
or 
iii 
then 
the 
Insurers 
liability 
to 
provide 
cover 
under 
this 
Section 
will 
cease 
immediately 
and 
the 
Insurer 
will 
not 
be 
responsible 
for 
the 
payment 
of 
Legal 
Expenses, 
Compensatory 
Awards 
or 
Data 
Protection 
Compensation 
Awards 
and 
will 
be 
entitled 
to 
reimbursement 
of 
all 
Legal 
Expenses 
already 
incurred 
in 
respect 
of 
the 
Claim 
unless 
the

agrees 
to 
appoint 
another

Representative 
to 
continue 
the 
Claim. 


h 
Award 
of 
Costs 
Where 
the 
Insured 
Person 
is 
awarded 
costs, 
it 
is 
a 
condition 
precedent 
to 
the 
Insurer's 
liability 
to 
provide 
cover 
under 
this 
Section 
that 
the 
Insured 
Person 
and 
the 
Legal 
Representative 
must 
take 
every 
reasonable 
step 
to 
recover 
Legal 
Expenses 
which 
would 
be 
or 
have 
been 
subject 
to 
payment 
under 
this 
Section. 
All 
such 
recoveries 
will 
be 
taken 
into 
account 
when 
calculating 
the 
Insurers 
liability 
under 
this 
Section. 


Alternative 
Dispute 
Resolution 
When, 
in 
the 
Insurers 
opinion, 
alternative 
dispute 
resolution 
would 
appear 
to 
provide 
a 
more 
effective 
method 
of 
resolving 
any 
Claim, 
the 
Insurer 
may 
request 
that 
the 
Insured 
Person 
agrees 
to 
submit 
such 
Claim 
to 
a 
professional 
dispute 
resolution 
service, 
to 
be 
selected 
by 
the 
Insurer. 


In 
considering 
alternative 
dispute 
resolution 
the 
Insured 
Person 
will 
comply 
with 
Claims 
Process 
Condition 
4 
and 
will 
not 
therefore 
unreasonably 
withhold 
Consent.

Important Information 

The 
Employers 
Liability 
(Compulsory 
Insurance) 
Regulations 
1998 
lay 
down 
certain 
obligations 
for 
employers 
and 
in 
particular 


You should be aware of the following 

Display of Certificates 

We 
will 
provide 
You 
with 
a 
Certificate 
of 
Employers 
Liability 
Insurance 
and 
this 
will 
state 
clearly 
the 
companies 
covered 
by 
it 
You 
must 
display 
either 
an 
original 
copy 
or 
make 
available 
a 
copy 
of 
the 
Certificate 
of 
Employers 
Liability 
Insurance 
in 
an 


electronic format at each Business Premises where Your Employees can see it easily 

Retention of Certificates 

The 
EmployersLiability 
(Compulsory 
InsuranceAmendment) 
Regulations 
2008 
remove 
the 
requirement 
for 
You 
to 
retain 
copies 
of 
Certificates 
of 
Employers 
Liability 
Insurance 
that 
have 
expired 
for 
at 
least 
40 
years 
However 
it 
is 
still 
good 
business 
practice 
to 
retain 
the 
Certificates 
because 
certain 
claims 
eg 
disease 
could 
be 
made 
many 
years 
after 
the 
disease 
is 
caused 
and 
if 
Your 
insurer 
can 
not 
be 
identified 
You 
could 
be 
liable 
for 
any 
payments

Please 
advise 
us 
of 
as 
much 
detail 
as 


possible to comply with your request. 

What information do we collect? 

We will collect personal information which may include your name, telephone number, email address, postal address, 
occupation, date of birth, additional details of risks related to your enquiry or product and payment details (including bank 

account 
number 
and 
sort

which 
we 
need 
to 
offer 
and 
provide 
the 
service 
or

or 
deal 
with 
a 
claim. 


We may need to request and collect sensitive personal information such as details of convictions or medical history that are 
necessary for providing you with the product, service or for processing a claim. 

We only collect and process sensitive personal data where it is critical for the delivery of a product or service and without 
which the product or service cannot be provided. We will therefore not seek explicit consent to process this information as the 
processing is legitimised by its criticality to the service provision. If you object to use of this information then we will be unable 

to 
offer 
you 
the 
product 
or 
service 
requested. 


How do we use your personal information? 

We will use your personal information to 

 assess and provide the products or services that you have requested 
 communicate with you 
 develop new products and services 
 undertake statistical analysis 

We may also take the opportunity to 

 contact you about products that are closely related to those you already hold with us 
 provide additional assistance or tips about these products or services 
 notify you of important functionality changes to our websites 
We make outbound phone calls for a variety of reasons relating to many of our products or services (for example, to update 
you on the progress of a claim or to discuss renewal of your insurance contract). We are fully committed to the regulations set 
out by Ofcom and follow strict processes to ensure we comply with them. 

To 
ensure 
confidentiality 
and 
security 
of 
the 
information 
we 
hold, 
we 
may 
need 
to 
request 
personal 
information 
and 
ask 


security questions to satisfy ourselves that you are who you say you are. 

We may aggregate information and statistics on website usage or for developing new and existing products and services, and 
we may also provide this information to third parties. These statistics will not include information that can be used to identify 
any individual. 

Securing your personal information 

We follow strict security procedures in the storage and disclosure of your personal information in line with industry practices, 
including storage in electronic and paper formats. 

We store all the information you provide to us, including information provided via forms you may complete on our websites, 
and information which we may collect from your browsing (such as clicks and page views on our websites). 

Any new information you provide us may be used to update an existing record we hold for you. 

When do we share your information?

crime,

may 
be 
submitted 
to

Identification 


This Policy is a legal contract between You and Us and designed to be as easy to understand as possible You must make a 
fair presentation of the risk to Us at inception renewal and variation of the Policy 

Your Proposal the Schedule Your Policy and any Endorsements shall be considered as one legal document 
It is important that You read all Your documents carefully and let Your insurance agent know immediately if the insurance does 
not meet Your requirements or if any information is inaccurate or incomplete If any changes are required this may result in 
changes to the terms and conditions of the Policy or a refusal to provide cover 

Index Linking 

Whenever a Sum Insured is declared to be subject to Index Linking it is adjusted at monthly intervals in accordance with 
appropriate indices as decided by Us 
At each renewal the premium will be adjusted to apply to the Sum Insured which then pertains and We waive all rights to 
additional premium arising solely out of such index adjustments prior to renewal 

Interest Clause 

The interests of third parties which You are required to include on this Policy under the terms of any mortgage property lease 
or hiring leasing or hire purchase agreement are automatically noted subject to You advising Us as soon as is reasonably 
practicable 

Fair Presentation of the Risk 

We are keen to work in partnership with You and avoid any misunderstandings 


1. You must make a fair presentation of the risk to Us at inception renewal and variation of the Policy 
Should You be in any doubt as to whether information should be presented to Us You must 
-discuss it with Your insurance agent or 
-disclose it to Us 
2. 
We may at Our absolute discretion avoid the Policy and refuse to pay any claims where any failure to make a fair 
presentation is 
(a) 
deliberate or reckless or 
(b) of such other nature that if You had made a fair presentation We would not have issued the Policy 
We will return the premium paid by You unless the failure to make a fair presentation is deliberate or reckless 
3. 
If 
We 
would 
have 
issued 
the 
Policy 
on 
different 
terms 
had 
You 
made 
a 
fair 
presentation 
We 
will 
not 
avoid 
the 
Policy except where the failure is deliberate or reckless but We may instead at Our absolute discretion 

(a) 
reduce proportionately the amount paid or payable on any claim the proportion for which We are liable 
being calculated by comparing the premium actually charged as a percentage of the premium which We 
would have charged had You made a fair presentation and or 
(b) 
treat the Policy as if it had included such additional terms other than those requiring payment of the 
premium as We would have imposed had You made a fair presentation 
For the purposes of this condition references to 

(i) 
avoiding a Policy means treating the Policy as if it had not existed from the inception date (where the failure to 
make a fair presentation of the risk occurs before the inception of the Policy) the renewal date (where the failure 
occurs at renewal of the Policy) or the date of change (where the failure occurs when the Policy is changed) 
(ii) 
refunds of premium should be treated as refunds of premium back to the inception date renewal date or date of 
change as the context requires 
(iii) 
issuing a Policy should be treated as the references to issuing the Policy at inception renewing or change of the 
Policy as the context requires 
(iv) 
premium should be treated as the premium payable for the particular contract of insurance which is subject to this 
condition where there is more than one contract of insurance

served on You before the Damage occurred. 

We will not pay any rate, tax, duty, development or other charge or 
assessment which may arise out of capital appreciation as a result of 
complying with any of the above regulations or requirements.

Additional factors when settling 
Buildings claims 

WhenWe Reinstate or Replace Property 

We may at our own option reinstate or replace any property destroyed 
or damaged without being bound to reinstate exactly or completely but 
only as circumstances permit and in reasonably sufficient manner. 

Rebuilding on Another Site 

The Buildings may be wholly or partially rebuilt on another site and in 
any manner suitable to Your requirements provided that it does not 
increase our liability. 

Partial Damage 

Where Damage occurs to only part of the property our liability shall 
not exceed the amount which We would have been liable to pay had 
the property been wholly destroyed. 

Obsolete Building Materials 

If the Buildings or damaged parts cannot be restored to their original 
form, We will rebuild or restore them with materials of a similar quality. 
In this instance, the Buildings will not be regarded as being in better 
condition than new, provided that our liability for any additional costs 
does not exceed 5% of the Declared value for that item. 

BuildingsAwaiting Demolition 

If at the time of the Damage any Buildings are awaiting demolition, our 
liability is limited to the additional cost of removing debris, as detailed in 
Cost C above, which is incurred by You solely as a result of such Damage. 

BuildingsAwaiting Refurbishment, Redevelopment or 
Renovation 

If at the time of the Damage any Buildings are awaiting refurbishment, 
redevelopment or renovation, We will not pay for any costs which 
would have been incurred by You in the absence of such Damage.

is extended, subject to exclusions A), B) and C), to include the 
irrecoverable costs and expenses necessarily incurred by You with our

£10,000 for such costs in respect of any one premises. 


16 | Properties Policy 

Further Investigation Costs 

If Your Buildings have suffered Damage and in the opinion of a 
competent construction professional there is a reasonable possibility of 
other Damage to parts of the same Buildings which is not immediately 
apparent, We will pay the costs incurred by You with our prior consent 
in establishing whether further Damage has occurred. We will also pay 
the costs incurred by You in establishing whether other Buildings owned 
by You in the vicinity have suffered Damage in the same incident. 

Alternative Basis of Settlement 

our liability shall be limited to the Alternative Basis of Settlement 

1 
if You do not rebuild or restore the Buildings 

2 
until the cost of reinstatement has actually been incurred 

3 
if the work of reinstatement is not carried out as quickly as is 
reasonably practicable 

4 
if at the time of its Damage the property is covered by any other 

insurance effected by You or on Your behalf and such other 

insurance is not on the identical basis of reinstatement defined in 

Cost A above 

5 
if in the schedule it is stated that the Alternative Basis of 
Settlement applies. 

Where the Alternative Basis of Settlement applies We will pay the 
reduction in market value of the Buildings immediately following the 
Damage solely as a result of the Damage but not exceeding the amount 
which would have been payable had the Buildings been rebuilt or repaired. 

Your sum insured -the penaltyfor underinsurance 

If at the time of the Damage the Declared value applying to the relevant 
Buildings item is less than 85% of the Insurable Amount (see below) You 
will be responsible for the difference and You will bear a proportionate 
share of the loss. 

Insurable Amount is the total of the above Costs A, B, C and D in 
reinstating the Buildings to a condition substantially the same as when 
new at the level of costs applying at the commencement of the period 
of insurance. 

However, if the loss is settled under the Alternative Basis of Settlement 
the Declared value of the relevant item shall be 115% of the base 
value shown and the Insurable Amount shall be the total of the value at 
the time of the Damage of the property insured by the item and the 
additional Costs B, C and D above. 

ValueAddedTax 

We will pay the Value Added Tax payable byYou which You are not 
subsequently able to recover, provided that 

1 A) 
Your liability for such tax arises solely from the rebuilding or 
restoration of the Buildings following Damage 

B) 
We have paid or agreed to pay for such Damage 

C) 
if the payment We make in respect of the rebuilding or 
restoration is less than the actual cost of rebuilding or 
restoration, We will only pay the same proportion of the Value 
Added Tax applicable 

2 
Your liability for such tax does not arise from the replacement 

Buildings having a greater floor area than or being in a better 

condition or more extensive than the damaged Buildings 

3 
if the Buildings are rebuilt on another site following Damage, We 

will not pay more Value Added Tax than We would have done had 

the rebuilding been completed at the original site 

4 
We will not pay any amounts in relation to penalties imposed upon 
You for late or non-payment of Value Added Tax. 

How We settle claims for Damage 
to Landlords Contents 

If any of the property insured under Landlords Contents suffers 
Damage by any event covered under this Insurance We will pay You 
the amount of loss or at our option repair or replace such property 
provided that our liability in any one period of insurance shall not 
exceed in respect of each item on Landlords Contents the sum insured 
shown in the schedule or any other stated Limit of Liability. 

As long as Damage is covered under this Insurance, 

Where the Damage can be economically repaired, We will either arrange 
or authorise repair and We will pay the cost of repair. Otherwise We will 
replace the item with a new one of similar quality through our preferred 
suppliers or, if a replacement is not available, We will pay the replacement 
cost of a new item of similar quality. 

If We agree at Your request not to repair or replace an item We will 
make a cash or voucher payment equal to the cost We would have paid 
for replacement or repair through our preferred suppliers. 

Additional factors when settling 
Landlords Contents claims 

Undamaged items or parts of items 

When the Damage relates to a specific part of an item or to a 
clearly defined area We will not pay the cost of replacing or changing 
undamaged items or parts of items which belong to a set or suite, or 
which have a common design or use such as suites of furniture and 
carpets which are only damaged in one area. 

Loss ofValue 

We will not pay for any loss of value to any item that We have repaired 
or replaced. 

Television, Audio and Video Equipment 

The most We will pay for any one claim in respect of television, audio 
and video equipment is £1,000. 

Your sum insured -the penaltyfor underinsurance 

If at the time of the Damage the sum insured applying to the relevant 
Landlords Contents item is less than the cost of replacing the contents 
as new, We will, where appropriate, take off an amount for wear and 
tear from the cost of the new item unless the item can be economically 
repaired when only the cost of the repair will be paid.

£50,000 whichever is the less 

except the amount We pay shall be adjusted to provide for any benefit 
derived by You from cancellation of or delay in the sale so that it represents 
as nearly as may be reasonably practicable the actual loss suffered by You. 

Savings 

If following Damage You use other premises to provide accommodation 
to tenants or prospective tenants of the Buildings, the rent received 
from those premises during the indemnity period shall be taken into 
account in assessing the Loss of rent. 

If any charge or expenses payable out of rent shall cease or reduce during 
the indemnity period as a result of the Damage, the sum saved shall be 
deducted from the amount otherwise payable. 

Material Damage requirement 

Payment must have been made or liability admitted for the Damage

Payment would have been made or liability admitted for the Damage 
but for the operation of a term in such insurance excluding liability for 
losses below a specified amount. 

ProfessionalAccountantsandLegalCharges

A) 
Your professional accountants for producing information required 
by Us under the terms of the Claims Conditions and for reporting 
that such information is in accordance with Your accounts 

B) 
legal advisers for determining Your contractual rights under any 
rent cessor clause or insurance break clause contained in the lease 
but not for any other claims preparation costs. 

LatePaymentof Rent 

We will attempt to pay any claim for Loss of rent on the same date 
as the rent would have been paid to You by the tenant. If We pay at 
a later date then We will also pay an amount representing the loss of 
interest suffered by You during the delay period. 

Payments on account 

Payments on account may at our discretion be made during the 
indemnity period if requested by You. 

Your sum insured the penaltyfor underinsurance 

If at the time of the Damage the sum insured for rent is less than 
the Insurable Amount (see below) the amount payable shall be 
proportionately reduced. 


18 | Properties Policy 

The Insurable Amount shall be the annual rent receivable at the 
commencement of the period of insurance or, if the Buildings are 
untenanted at that date, the actual annual rent at which the Buildings 
were subsequently let (or the estimated annual rent at which they are 
expected to be let). 

If the Buildings are subject to a rent free period concession at the start 
of the period of insurance the Insurable Amount shall be the annual rent 
that applies from the date immediately after the rent free period ceases. 

In each case the amount to be proportionately increased to correspond 
with the indemnity period where that period exceeds twelve months. 

other considerations when 
settling any claims under this 
insurance

shall be determined by the designation under which such property 
appears in Your books. 

Workmen

of workmen on the premises for the purpose of effecting repairs and 
minor structural and other alterations and also for general maintenance 
purposes and the like. 

Plans and Documents in Support of the Claim 

You shall at Your own expense produce and provide Us with all such 
plans, documents, books and information as We may reasonably require. 

Transfer of Interest

this Insurance You shall have contracted to sell Your interest in such 
Buildings and the purchase is subsequently completed the purchaser 
shall be entitled on completion of the purchase to the benefit of this 
Insurance in respect of such Damage. Such benefit shall be without 
prejudice to Your or our rights and liabilities under this Insurance and 
up to the date of completion of the purchase provided the Buildings are 
not insured by the purchaser or on his behalf against such Damage on 
another policy. 

In respect of rent (if included) where Damage has occurred prior to 
exchange of contracts and the purchase is subsequently completed the 
purchaser shall be entitled on completion of the purchase to the benefit 
of the rent insurance to the same extent as You would have if the 
Buildings had not been sold. 

Automatic Reinstatement After a Loss 

In the absence of written notice by You or Us to the contrary within 30 
days of the occurrence of any Damage the applicable sum insured (or 
other restriction on the amount of our liability under this Insurance) shall 
not be reduced by the amount of any loss provided that You shall pay 
the appropriate additional premium for such automatic reinstatement of 
cover and provided also that in respect of Damage by theft (if insured) 
such automatic reinstatement shall apply on the first occasion only in each
